<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The remarkable degree of interest expressed on all sides, at the present
time, relative to the island of Cuba, has led the author of the following
pages to place together in this form a series of notes from his journal,
kept during a brief residence upon the island. To these he has prefixed
a historical glance at the political story of Cuba, that may not be unworthy
of preservation. The fact that the subject-matter was penned in the
hurry of observation upon the spot, and that it is thus a simple record of
what would be most likely to engage and interest a stranger, is his excuse
for the desultory character of the work. So critically is the island now
situated, in a political point of view, that ere this book shall have passed
through an edition, it may be no longer a dependency of Spain, or may
have become the theatre of scenes to which its former convulsions shall
bear no parallel.</p>

<p>In preparing the volume for the press, the author has felt the want of
books of reference, bearing a late date. Indeed, there are none; and the
only very modern records are those written in the desultory manner of
hurried travellers. To the admirable work of the learned Ramon de la
Sagra,&mdash;a monument of industry and intelligence,&mdash;the author of the
following pages has been indebted for historical suggestions and data. For
the privilege of consulting this, and other Spanish books and pamphlets,
relative to the interests and history of the island, the author is indebted
to the Hon. Edward Everett, who kindly placed them at his disposal.
Where statistics were concerned, the several authorities have been carefully
collated, and the most responsible given. The writer has preferred to
offer the fresh memories of a pleasant trip to the tropics, to attempting a
labored volume abounding in figures and statistics; and trusts that this
summer book of a summer clime may float lightly upon the sea of public
favor.<span style="margin-left:16em">M.M.B.</span></p>

<p>The island of Cuba, one of the earliest discoveries of
the great admiral, has been known to Europe since 1492,
and has borne, successively, the names of Juana,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Fernandina,
Santiago and Ave Maria, having found refuge at last
in the aboriginal appellation. Soon after its discovery by
Columbus, it was colonized by Spaniards from St. Domingo,
but was considered mainly in the light of a military dep&ocirc;t,
by the home government, in its famous operations at that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
period in Mexico. The fact that it was destined to prove
the richest jewel in the Castilian crown, and a mine of
wealth to the Spanish treasury, was not dreamed of at this
stage of its history. Even the enthusiastic followers of Cortez,
who sought that fabulous El Dorado of the New World,
had no golden promise to hold forth for this gem of the
Caribbean Sea.</p>

<p>The Spanish colonists from St. Domingo found the island
inhabited by a most peculiar native race, hospitable, inoffensive,
timid, fond of the dance and the rude music of
their own people, yet naturally indolent and lazy, from the
character of the climate they inhabited. They had some
definite idea of God and heaven; and were governed by
patriarchs, or kings, whose word was law, and whose age
gave them precedence. They had few weapons of offence
or defence, and knew not the use of the bow and arrow.
Of course, they were at once subjected by the new comers,
who reduced them to a state of slavery; and, proving hard
taskmasters, the poor, over-worked natives died in scores,
until they had nearly disappeared, when the home government
granted permission to import a cargo of negroes from
the coast of Africa to labor upon the ground, and to seek
for gold, which was thought to exist in the river-courses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Thus early commenced the slave-trade of Cuba, a subject
to which we shall have occasion more fully to refer.</p>

<p>Cuba became the head-quarters of the Spanish power in
the west, forming the point of departure for those military
expeditions which, though inconsiderable in numbers, were
so formidable in the energy of the leaders, and in the arms,
discipline, courage, ferocity, fanaticism and avarice, of their
followers, that they were amply adequate to carry out the
vast schemes of conquest for which they were designed.
It was hence that Cortez marched to the conquest of Mexico,&mdash;a
gigantic undertaking&mdash;one a slight glance at which
will recall to the reader the period of history to which we
would direct his attention. Landing upon the continent,
with a little band, scarcely more than half the complement
of a modern regiment, he prepared to traverse an unknown
country, thronged by savage tribes, with whose character,
habits and means of defence, he was wholly unacquainted.
This romantic adventure, worthy of the palmiest days of
chivalry, was crowned with success, though checkered with
various fortune, and stained with bloody episodes, that
prove how the threads of courage and ferocity are inseparably
blended in the woof and warp of Spanish character.
It must be remembered, however, that the spirit of the
age was harsh, relentless and intolerant; and, that if the
Aztecs, idolaters and sacrificers of human victims, found no
mercy at the hands of the fierce Catholics whom Cortez<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
commanded, neither did the Indians of our own section of
the continent fare much better at the hands of men professing
a purer faith, and coming to these shores, not as warriors,
with the avowed purpose of conquest, but themselves
persecuted fugitives.</p>

<p>As the first words that greeted the ears of the Plymouth
colonists were "Welcome, Englishmen!" uttered by a poor
native, who had learned them from the fishermen off the
northern coast, so were the Spaniards at first kindly welcomed
by the aborigines they encountered in the New
World. Yet, in the north-east and south-west the result
was the same: it mattered little whether the stranger was
Roman Catholic or Protestant; whether he came clad in
steel, or robed in the garments of peace; whether he spoke
the harsh English, the soft French, or the rich Castilian
tongue. The inexorable laws which govern races were rigidly
enforced; the same drama was everywhere enacted, the
white race enjoying a speedy triumph. There were episodical
struggles, fierce and furious, but unavailing; here
Guatimozin, there Philip of Pokanoket&mdash;here a battle, there
a massacre.</p>

<p>The Spanish general encountered a people who had attained
a far higher point of art and civilization than their
red brethren of the north-east part of the continent. Vast
pyramids, imposing sculptures, curious arms, fanciful garments,
various kinds of manufactures, the relics of which
still strangely interest the student of the past, filled the in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>vaders
with surprise. There was much that was curious
and startling in their mythology, and the capital of the
Mexican empire presented a singular and fascinating spectacle
to the eyes of Cortez. The rocky amphitheatre in
the midst of which it was built still remains unchanged,
but the vast lake which surrounded it, traversed by causeways,
and covered with floating gardens, laden with flowers
and perfume, is gone. The star of the Aztec dynasty set
in blood. In vain did the inhabitants of the conquered city,
roused to madness by the cruelty and extortion of the victors,
expel them from their midst. Cortez refused to flee
further than the shore; the light of his burning galleys
rekindled the desperate valor of his followers, and Mexico
fell, as a few years after did Peru under the perfidy and
sword of Pizarro, thus completing the scheme of conquest,
and giving Spain a colonial empire more splendid than that
of any other power in Christendom.</p>

<p>Of the agents in this vast scheme of territorial aggrandizement,
we see Cortez dying in obscurity, and Pizarro
assassinated in his palace, while retributive justice has overtaken
the monarchy at whose behests the richest portions of
the western continent were violently wrested from their
native possessors. If "the wild and warlike, the indolent
and the semi-civilized, the bloody Aztec, the inoffensive
Peruvian, the fierce Araucanian, all fared alike" at the
hands of Spain, it must be confessed that their wrongs have
been signally avenged. "The horrid atrocities practised at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
home and abroad," says Edward Everett, "not only in the
Netherlands, but in every city of the northern country,
cried to Heaven for vengeance upon Spain; nor could she
escape it. She intrenched herself behind the eternal
Cordilleras; she took to herself the wings of the morning,
and dwelt in the uttermost parts of the sea; but even there
the arm of retribution laid hold of her, and the wrongs
of both hemispheres were avenged by her degeneracy and
fall."</p>

<p>So rapid a fall is almost without a parallel in the history
of the world. Less than three centuries from the time
when she stood without a rival in the extent and wealth of
her colonial possessions, she beheld herself stripped, one by
one, of the rich exotic jewels of her crown. Her vice-regal
coronet was torn from her grasp. Mexico revolted; the
South American provinces threw off her yoke; and now,
though she still clutches with febrile grasp the brightest gem
of her transatlantic possessions, the island of Cuba, yet it
is evident that she cannot long retain its ownership. The
"ever-faithful" island has exhibited unmistakable symptoms
of infidelity, its demonstrations of loyalty being confined to
the government officials and the hireling soldiery. The
time will surely come when the last act of the great drama
of historical retribution will be consummated, and when, in
spite of the threatening batteries of the Moro and the Punta,
and the bayonets of Spanish legions, <i>siempre fiel</i> will no
longer be the motto of the Queen of the Antilles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>The history of Cuba is deficient in events of a stirring
character, and yet not devoid of interest. Columbus found
it inhabited, as we have already remarked, by a race whose
manners and character assimilated with the mild climate of
this terrestrial paradise. Although the Spanish conquerors
have left us but few details respecting these aborigines, yet
we know with certainty, from the narratives of the great
discoverer and his followers, that they were docile and
generous, but, at the same time, inclined to ease; that they
were well-formed, grave, and far from possessing the vivacity
of the natives of the south of Europe. They expressed
themselves with a certain modesty and respect, and
were hospitable to the last degree. Their labor was limited
to the light work necessary to provide for the wants
of life, while the bounteous climate of the tropics spared
the necessity of clothing. They preferred hunting and fishing
to agriculture; and beans and maize, with the fruits
that nature gave them in abundance, rendered their diet
at once simple and nutritious. They possessed no quadrupeds
of any description, except a race of voiceless dogs,
of whose existence we have no proof but the assertion of
the discoverers.</p>

<p>The island was politically divided into nine provinces,
namely, Baracoa, Bayaguitizi, Macaca, Bayamo, Camaguey,
Jagua, Cueyba, Habana and Haniguanica. At the head of
each was a governor, or king, of whose laws we have no
record, or even tradition. An unbroken peace reigned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
among them, nor did they turn their hands against any other
people. Their priests, called <i>Behiques</i>, were fanatics,
superstitious to the last degree, and kept the people in fear
by gross extravagances. They were not cannibals, nor did
they employ human sacrifices, and are represented as distinguished
by a readiness to receive the Gospel.</p>

<p>The capital of the island was Baracoa,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> erected into a
city and bishopric in 1518, but both were transferred to
Santiago de Cuba in 1522. In the year 1538, the city of
Havana was surprised by a French corsair and reduced to
ashes. The French and English buccaneers of the West
Indies, whose hatred the Spaniards early incurred, were for
a long time their terror and their scourge. Enamored of
the wild life they led, unshackled by any laws but the rude
regulations they themselves adopted, unrefined by intercourse
with the gentler sex, consumed by a thirst for adventure,
and brave to ferocity, these fierce rovers, for many
years, were the actual masters of the gulf. They feared
no enemy, and spared none; their vessels, constantly on
the watch for booty, were ever ready, on the appearance of
a galleon, to swoop down like an eagle on its prey. The
romance of the sea owes some of its most thrilling chapters
to the fearful exploits of these buccaneers. Their <i>coup de
main</i> on Havana attracted the attention of De Soto, the
governor of the island, to the position and advantages of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
port at which the Spanish vessels bound for the peninsula
with the riches of New Mexico were accustomed to touch,
and he accordingly commenced to fortify it. It increased
in population by degrees, and became the habitual gubernatorial
residence, until the home government made it the
capital of the island in 1589, on the appointment of the first
Captain-general, Juan de Tejada.</p>

<p>The native population soon dwindled away under the
severe sway of the Spaniards, who imposed upon them
tasks repugnant to their habits, and too great for their
strength.</p>

<p>Velasquez, one of the earliest governors of the island,
appears to have been an energetic and efficient magistrate,
and to have administered affairs with vigor and intelligence;
but his harsh treatment of the aborigines will ever remain
a stain upon his memory. A native chief, whose only crime
was that of taking up arms in defence of the integrity of
his little territory, fell into the hands of Velasquez, and was
burned alive, as a punishment for his patriotism.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It is no
wonder that under such treatment the native population
disappeared so rapidly that the Spaniards were forced to
supply their places by laborers of hardier character.</p>

<p>We have seen that the office of captain-general was established
in 1589, and, with a succession of incumbents, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
office has been maintained until the present day, retaining
the same functions and the same extraordinary powers.
The object of the Spanish government is, and ever has
been, to derive as much revenue as possible from the island;
and the exactions imposed upon the inhabitants have increased
in proportion as other colonies of Spain, in the
western world, have revolted and obtained their independence.
The imposition of heavier burthens than those imposed
upon any other people in the world has been the reward
of the proverbial loyalty of the Cubans; while the
epithet of "ever-faithful," bestowed by the crown, has been
their only recompense for their steady devotion to the throne.
But for many years this lauded loyalty has existed only in
appearance, while discontent has been fermenting deeply
beneath the surface.</p>

<p>The Cubans owe all the blessings they enjoy to Providence
alone (so to speak), while the evils which they suffer are
directly referable to the oppression of the home government.
Nothing short of a military despotism could maintain the
connection of such an island with a mother country more
than three thousand miles distant; and accordingly we find
the captain-general of Cuba invested with unlimited power.
He is, in fact, a viceroy appointed by the crown of Spain,
and accountable only to the reigning sovereign for his administration
of the colony. His rule is absolute; he has
the power of life and death and liberty in his hands. He
can, by his arbitrary will, send into exile any person what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>ever,
be his name or rank what it may, whose residence in
the island he considers prejudicial to the royal interest, even
if he has committed no overt act. He can suspend the
operation of the laws and ordinances, if he sees fit to do so;
can destroy or confiscate property; and, in short, the
island may be said to be perpetually in a state of siege.</p>

<p>Such is the infirmity of human nature that few individuals
can be trusted with despotic power without abusing it;
and accordingly we find very few captain-generals whose
administration will bear the test of rigid examination. Few
men who have governed Cuba have consulted the true interests
of the Creoles; in fact, they are not appointed for
that purpose, but merely to look after the crown revenue.
An office of such magnitude is, of course, a brilliant prize,
for which the grandees of Spain are constantly struggling;
and the means by which an aspirant is most likely to secure
the appointment presupposes a character of an inferior order.
The captain-general knows that he cannot reckon on
a long term of office, and hence he takes no pains to study
the interests or gain the good-will of the Cubans. He
has a two-fold object in view,&mdash;to keep the revenue well
up to the mark, and to enrich himself as speedily as possible.
Hence, the solemn obligations entered into by Spain
with the other powers for the suppression of the African
slave-trade are a dead letter; for, with very few exceptions,
the captains-general of Cuba have connived at the illegal
importation of slaves, receiving for their complaisance a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
large percentage on the value of each one landed on the
island; for, though the slavers do not discharge their living
freights at the more frequented ports, still their arrival is a
matter of public notoriety, and it is impossible that, with
the present system of espionage, the authorities can be
ignorant of such an event. Nor can we imagine that the
home government is less well-informed upon the subject,
though they assume a politic ignorance of the violation of
the law. Believing that the importation of slaves is essential
to the maintenance of the present high revenue, Spain
illustrates the rule that there are none so blind as those who
do not wish to see. It is only the cheapness of labor, resulting
from the importation of slaves, that enables the
planters to pour into the government treasury from twenty
to twenty-four millions of dollars annually. Of this we
may speak more fully hereafter.</p>

<p>In 1760, the invasion and conquest of the island by the
British forms one of the most remarkable epochs in its
history. This event excited the fears of Spain, and directed
the attention of the government to its importance in a political
point of view. On its restoration, at the treaty of peace
concluded between the two governments in the following year,
Spain seriously commenced the work of fortifying the Havana,
and defending and garrisoning the island generally.</p>

<p>The elements of prosperity contained within the limits of
this peerless island required only a patriotic and enlightened
administration for their development; and the germ of its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
civilization was stimulated by the appointment of General
Don Luis de las Casas to the post of captain-general. During
the administration of this celebrated man, whose memory
is cherished with fond respect by the Cubans, The Patriotic
Society of Havana was formed, with the noble idea of diffusing
education throughout the island, and introducing a
taste for classical literature, through his instrumentality,
while the press was also established in the capital, by the
publication of the <i>Papel Periodico</i>.</p>

<p>In the first third of the present century, the <i>intendente</i>,
Don Alejandro Ramirez, labored to regulate the revenues
and economical condition of the country, and called the attention
of the government to the improvement of the white
population. But the most important concession obtained of
the metropolitan government, the freedom of commerce, was
due to the patriotic exertions of Don Francisco de Arranjo,
the most illustrious name in Cuban annals, "one," says the
Countess Merlin, "who may be quoted as a model of the
humane and peaceful virtues," and "who was," says Las
Casas, "a jewel of priceless value to the glory of the nation,
a protector for Cuba, and an accomplished statesman
for the monarchy." Even the briefest historical sketch
(and this record pretends to no more) would be incomplete
without particular mention of this excellent man.</p>

<p>He was born at Havana, May 22d, 1765. Left an orphan
at a very early age, he managed the family estate,
while a mere boy, with a discretion and judgment which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
would have done honor to a man of mature age. Turning
his attention to the study of the law, he was admitted to
practice in the mother country, where for a considerable
period he acted as the agent for the municipality of Havana,
and, being thoroughly acquainted with the capabilities of the
island, and the condition and wants of his countrymen, he
succeeded in procuring the amelioration of some of the most
flagrant abuses of the colonial system. By his exertions, the
staple productions of the island were so much increased that
the revenue, in place of falling short of the expenses of the
government, as his enemies had predicted, soon yielded a large
surplus. He early raised his voice against the iniquitous
slave-trade, and suggested the introduction of white laborers,
though he perceived that the abolition of slavery was impracticable.
It was owing to his exertions that the duty on
coffee, spirits and cotton, was remitted for a period of ten
years, and that machinery was allowed to be imported free
of duty to the island.</p>

<p>The <i>Junta de Fomento</i> (society for improvement) and
the Chamber of Commerce were the fruits of his indefatigable
efforts. Of the latter institution he was for a long time
the Syndic, refusing to receive the perquisites attached to
the office, as he did the salaries of the same and other offices
that he filled during his useful life. While secretary of the
Chamber, he distinguished himself by his bold opposition to
the schemes of the infamous Godoy (the Prince of Peace),
the minion of the Queen of Spain, who, claiming to be pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>tector
of the Chamber of Commerce, demanded the receipts
of the custom-house at Havana. He not only defeated the
plans of Godoy, but procured the relinquishment of the
royal monopoly of tobacco. His patriotic services were appreciated
by the court at Madrid, although at times he was
the inflexible opponent of its schemes. The cross of the
order of Charles III. showed the esteem in which he was
held by that monarch. Yet, with a modesty which did him
honor, he declined to accept a title of nobility which was
afterwards offered to him. In 1813, when, by the adoption
of the constitution of 1812, Cuba became entitled to representation
in the general Cortes, he visited Madrid as a deputy,
and there achieved the crowning glory of his useful
life,&mdash;the opening of the ports of Cuba to foreign trade.
In 1817 he returned to his native island with the rank of
Counsellor of State, Financial Intendente of Cuba, and
wearing the grand cross of the order of Isabella. He died in
1837, at the age of seventy-two, after a long and eminently
useful life, bequeathing large sums for various public purposes
and charitable objects in the island. Such a man is an
honor to any age or nation, and the Cubans do well to cherish
his memory, which, indeed, they seem resolved, by frequent
and kindly mention, to keep ever green.</p>

<p>Fostered by such men, the resources of Cuba, both physical
and intellectual, received an ample and rapid development.
The youth of the island profited by the means of
instruction now liberally placed at their disposal; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
sciences and belles-lettres were assiduously cultivated; agriculture
and internal industry were materially improved, and
an ambitious spirit evoked, which subsequent periods of
tyranny and misrule have not been able, with all their baneful
influences, entirely to erase.</p>

<p>The visitor from abroad is sure to hear the people refer
to this "golden period," as they call it, of their history,
the influence of which, so far from passing away, appears
to grow and daily increase with them. It raised in their
bosoms one spirit and trust which they sadly needed,&mdash;that
of self-reliance,&mdash;and showed them of what they were
capable, under liberal laws and judicious government.</p>

<p>When the French invasion of Spain in 1808 produced
the constitution of 1812, Cuba was considered entitled to
enjoy its benefits, and the year 1820 taught the Cubans the
advantage to be derived by a people from institutions based
on the principle of popular intervention in public affairs.
The condition of the nation on the death of Ferdinand VII.
obliged Queen Christina to rely on the liberal party for a
triumph over the pretensions of the Infante Don Carlos to
the crown, and to assure the throne of Donna Isabella II.,
and the <i>Estatuto Real</i> (royal statute) was proclaimed
in Spain and Cuba. The Cubans looked forward, as in
1812 and 1820, to a representation in the national congress,
and the enjoyment of the same liberty conceded to the Peninsula.
An institution was then established in Havana,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
with branches in the island, called the Royal Society for
Improvement, already alluded to in our brief notice of Don
Francisco Arranjo. The object of this society was to aid
and protect the progress of agriculture and commerce; and
it achieved a vast amount of good. At the same time, the
press, within the narrow limits conceded to it, discussed with
intelligence and zeal the interests of the country, and diffused
a knowledge of them.</p>

<p>In 1836 the revolution known as that of La Granja, provoked
and sustained by the progressionists against the moderate
party, destroyed the "Royal Statute," and proclaimed
the old constitution of 1812. The queen-mother, then
Regent of Spain, convoked the constituent Cortes, and summoned
deputies from Cuba.</p>

<p>Up to this time, various political events, occurring within
a brief period, had disturbed but slightly and accidentally
the tranquillity of this rich province of Spain. The Cubans,
although sensible of the progress of public intelligence and
wealth, under the protection of a few enlightened governors,
and through the influence of distinguished and patriotic
individuals, were aware that these advances were slow, partial
and limited, that there was no regular system, and that
the public interests, confided to officials intrusted with unlimited
power, and liable to the abuses inseparable from
absolutism, frequently languished, or were betrayed by a
cupidity which impelled despotic authorities to enrich themselves
in every possible way at the expense of popular suf<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>fering.
Added to these sources of discontent was the
powerful influence exerted over the intelligent portion of
the people by the portentous spectacle of the rapidly-increasing
greatness of the United States, where a portion of
the Cuban youths were wont to receive their education, and
to learn the value of a national independence based on democratic
principles, principles which they were apt freely to
discuss after returning to the island.</p>

<p>There also were the examples of Mexico and Spanish
South America, which had recently conquered with their
blood their glorious emancipation from monarchy. Liberal
ideas were largely diffused by Cubans who had travelled in
Europe, and there imbibed the spirit of modern civilization.
But, with a fatuity and obstinacy which has always characterized
her, the mother country resolved to ignore these
causes of discontent, and, instead of yielding to the popular
current, and introducing a liberal and mild system of government,
drew the reins yet tighter, and even curtailed
many of the privileges formerly accorded to the Cubans.
It is a blind persistence in the fated principle of despotic
domination which has relaxed the moral and political bonds
uniting the two countries, instilled gall into the hearts of
the governed, and substituted the dangerous obedience of
terror for the secure loyalty of love. This severity of the
home government has given rise to several attempts to throw
off the Spanish yoke.</p>

<p>The first occurred in 1823, when the Liberator, Simon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Bolivar, offered to aid the disaffected party by throwing an
invading force into the island. The conspiracy then formed,
by the aid of the proffered expedition, for which men were
regularly enlisted and enrolled, would undoubtedly have
ended in the triumph of the insurrection, had it not been
discovered and suppressed prematurely, and had not the
governments of the United States, Great Britain and
France, intervened in favor of Spain. In 1826 some Cuban
emigrants, residing in Caraccas, attempted a new expedition,
which failed, and caused the imprisonment and execution
of two patriotic young men, Don Francisco de Ag&uuml;ero,
y Velazco, and Don Bernab&eacute; Sanchez, sent to raise the department
of the interior. In 1828 there was a yet more
formidable conspiracy, known as <i>El Aguila Negra</i> (the
black eagle). The efforts of the patriots proved unavailing,
foiled by the preparation and power of the government,
which seems to be apprised by spies of every intended
movement for the cause of liberty in Cuba.</p>

<p>We have alluded to the revolution of La Granja, in
Spain, and we have now briefly to consider its effects on the
island of Cuba, then under the sway of General Don Miguel
Tacon. We shall have occasion to refer more than
once, in the course of our records of the island, to the administration
of Tacon; for he made his mark upon Cuba,
and, though he governed it with an iron hand and a stern
will, as we shall see, yet he did much to improve its physical
condition, even as Louis Napoleon, despot though he be,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
has already vastly beautified and improved the sanitary
condition of the city of Paris.</p>

<p>The first place on the island which received intelligence
of the revolution of La Granja, and the oath to the constitution
of 1812 by the Queen-Regent of Spain, was Santiago
de Cuba, the capital of the eastern department. It was
then commanded by General Lorenzo, who immediately
assembled the authorities, corporations and functionaries, in
pursuance of the example of his predecessors,&mdash;who, without
waiting for the orders of the higher authority of the island,
had, under similar circumstances, prepared to obey the supreme
government of the nation,&mdash;and proclaimed through
his department the Code of Cadiz, without any opposition,
and to the general joy of Spaniards and Cubans. His first
acts were to re&euml;stablish the constitutional <i>ayuntamiento</i>,
the national militia, the liberty of the press, and all other
institutions, on the same footing as in 1823, when King
Ferdinand recovered absolute authority, and made arrangements
for the election of deputies to the new Cortes.</p>

<p>Tacon, who was not a friend to liberal institutions, and
who was fixed in his idea that the new constitution would
convulse the country, notwithstanding his knowledge of the
state of things when this law was actually in force in Cuba,
was quite indignant when he heard what had transpired.
Knowing that he could not compel General Lorenzo to
abrogate the constitution he had proclaimed, he forthwith
cut off all communication with the eastern department, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
formed a column to invade it, and to restore the old order
of things by force. This was a bold, impolitic and dangerous
move, because this resolve was contrary to the wishes
of the supreme government and public opinion, which would
not fail to see treason in the act of Gen. Tacon, against the
mother country.</p>

<p>Although the royal proclamation which announced to
Tacon the establishment of the constitution in Spain intimated
forthcoming orders for the election of deputies in
Cuba to the general Cortes, still he considered that his
commission as captain-general authorized him, under the
circumstances, to carry out his own will, and suppress at
once the movement set on foot by General Lorenzo, on
the ground of its danger to the peace of the island, and the
interests of Spain. The royal order, which opened the way
for his attacks upon the Cuban people, after a confused preamble,
confers on the captain-general all the authority appertaining
in time of war to a Spanish governor of a city
in a state of siege, authorizing him in any circumstances
and by his proper will to suspend any public functionary,
whatever his rank, civil, military, or ecclesiastical; to
banish any resident of the island, without preferring any accusations;
to modify any law, or suspend its operations;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
disobey with impunity any regulation emanating from the
Spanish government; to dispose of the public revenues at
his will; and, finally, to act according to his pleasure, winding
up with recommending a moderate use of the confidence
evinced by the sovereign in according power so ample.</p>

<p>Although the captains-general of Cuba have always
been invested with extraordinary power, we believe that
these items of unlimited authority were first conferred upon
Vivez in 1825, when the island was menaced by an invasion
of the united forces of Mexico and Columbia. In these
circumstances, and emanating from an absolute authority,
like that of Ferdinand VII., a delegation of power which
placed the destinies of the island at the mercy of its chief
ruler might have had the color of necessity; but to continue
such a delegation of authority in time of peace is a
most glaring and inexcusable blunder.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tacon assembled a column of picked companies
of the line, the provincial military and rural cavalry,
and placed them, under the orders of General Gascue, in the
town of Guines, hoping by this great parade and preparation
to impose on General Lorenzo, and strike terror into
the inhabitants of the whole island. He also adroitly
worked by secret agents upon the forces at Santiago de
Cuba, and thus by cunning and adroitness brought about
quite a re&auml;ction in the public sentiment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Under these circumstances, if General Lorenzo, master
of the eastern department, with two regiments of regular
troops, all the national militia, all devoted to the new order
of things and ready to obey his will, had marched upon
Puerto Principe, the capital of the centre, where the garrison
was not strong enough to oppose him, and had there
proclaimed the constitutional code through the authority of
the royal <i>Audiencia</i>, Gen. Tacon would unquestionably
have desisted from his opposition, and relinquished the
command of the island. Cuba would then have enjoyed
the same political rights as the rest of Spain, and have
escaped the horrors of tyranny which have since weighed
her down. But Gen. Lorenzo proved weak, let slip the
golden opportunity of triumphing over Tacon, and returned
to Spain in the vain hope that the supreme government
would sustain him. In the mean time, Tacon sent his body
of soldiery to Santiago, their arrival being signalized by the
establishment of a military commission to try and punish
all who had been engaged innocently in establishing the
fallen constitution. The commandant Moya presided, and
the advocate Miret was held as counsel.</p>

<p>No sooner had this barbarous tribunal commenced its
proceedings, than no Creole belonging to families of influence
could look upon himself as safe from persecution, since
nearly all of them had hastened to obey the orders of
General Lorenzo, and, like him, taken oath to the constitution.
Many men of rank, reputation and education, includ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>ing
several respectable clergymen, fell under the ban of the
military commission. Some were thrown into the prisons
of Santiago de Cuba, some banished for a given period, and
many emigrated to avoid the horrors of a Spanish dungeon,
and the greater part in one way or another were torn from
the bosoms of their families. Of the soldiers who faithfully
obeyed their officers, about five hundred were condemned
to work in the streets of Havana, with their feet
shackled. Such are the measures meted out by despotism
to those who have the misfortune to live under its iron yoke.</p>

<p>Tacon triumphed, yet the Cubans did not utterly despair.
They cherished the hope that the Spanish government
would recognize the legality of their proceedings in the
eastern department; but they were doomed to disappointment.
The Cuban deputies presented themselves in the
Spanish capital, and offered their credentials. But they
were referred to a committee of men profoundly ignorant of
the feelings, opinions and condition, of the Cuban people, or
deriving what few notions they possessed from those interested
on the side of Tacon. The deputies were not allowed
a seat in the Cortes, and the government decided that the
provisions of the constitution should not apply to Cuba,
but that it should be governed by special laws. Since then,
the island has been ruled by the arbitrary will of the captains-general,
without intervention of the Spanish Cortes,
without the intervention of the island, and, what is almost
inconceivable, at first thought, without the direct action even
of the sovereign authority.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>Tacon, now that the royal authority had sustained his
action, was more despotic than ever. It is true that he introduced
some legal and municipal reforms; that he embellished
the capital, and improved its health; but under him
the censorship of the press was almost prohibitory. The
local <i>ayuntamientos</i>, which, at the most despotic epoch,
had frequently produced happy effects, by representing to
the sovereign the wants of the country, were shorn of their
privileges, and their attributes confined to the collection
and distribution of the municipal funds. Tacon is also
charged with promoting the jealousies naturally existing
between Spaniards and Creoles, and with completely subjecting
the civil courts to military tribunals.</p>

<p>"In a state of agitation in the public mind, and disorder
in the government," says the author of an able pamphlet
entitled "<i>Cuba y su Gobierno</i>," to whom we are indebted
for invaluable information that could only be imparted by a
Creole, "with the political passions of Spaniards and Cubans
excited; the island reduced from an integral part of the
monarchy to the condition of a colony, and with no other
political code than the royal order, conferring unlimited
power upon the chief authority; the country bowed down
under the weighty tyranny of two military commissions
established in the capitals of the eastern and western departments;
with the prisons filled with distinguished patriots;
deprived of representation in the Cortes; the <i>ayuntamientos</i>
prohibited the right of petition; the press forbidden to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
enunciate the state of public opinion, closed the administration
of General Don Miguel Tacon in the island of Cuba,
the most calamitous, beyond a question, that this country
has suffered since its discovery by the Spaniards."</p>

<p>The liberal party of Cuba, denied the expression of their
views in the local prints, and anxious to present their wants
and their grievances before the home government, conceived
the ingenious idea of establishing organs abroad. Two
papers were accordingly published; one at Paris, called "<i>El
Correo de Ultramar</i>" and one at Madrid, entitled "<i>El Observador</i>,"
edited by distinguished Cubans.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> It is scarcely
necessary to say that these produced no favorable result,
and the people of the island became convinced that the
mother country was resolved to persevere in the plan of
ruling Cuba with a rod of iron, indifferent alike to her tears
and her remonstrances.</p>

<p>The programme of the liberal party was exceedingly
moderate, petitioning only for the following concessions:
1st, That a special ministry, devoted to Cuban affairs, should
be established at Madrid; 2d, That a legal organ of communication
between Spain and Cuba should be established
in the island, to represent the well-defined interests of the
metropolis and the colony; 3d, That some latitude should be
given to the press, now controlled by a triple censorship;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
4th, That efficacious means should be adopted for the complete
suppression of the barbarous traffic in African slaves;
5th, That the government should permit the establishment
of societies for the improvement of the white inhabitants;
6th, That the island should be relieved of the enormous
weight of the contributions now levied upon her. None of
these privileges, however, have been conceded to suffering
Cuba by the home government.</p>

<p>The first successor of General Tacon ruled Cuba with a
spirit of moderation and temperance, seeking to conciliate
the liberals, and giving hopes of great reforms, which as
yet have never been accomplished. During the administration
of the Prince de Aglona, a superior tribunal, the
Royal Pretorial Audience, was established in Havana, to take
cognizance of civil suits in cases of appeal, and to resolve
the doubts which the confused system of legislation produces
at every step in the inferior tribunals. Gen. Valdes was
the first and only official who granted free papers to the
emancipated negroes who had served out their term of apprenticeship,
and who opposed the African trade. He showed,
by his example, that this infamous traffic may be destroyed
in the country without a necessary resort to violent measures,
but by the will of the captain-general.</p>

<p>General O'Donnell, as captain-general,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> instead of re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>pressing,
encouraged the slave-trade, and a greater number
of the unfortunate victims of human avarice were introduced
into the island, during his administration, than during
any like term since the conclusion of the treaty of 1817.
Of course he vacated his post vastly enriched by the spoils,
having doubtless received, as was declared, from one to two
doubloons per head on every slave landed upon the island
during his administration; a sum that would alone amount
to a fortune.</p>

<p>Of events which transpired during the administration of
Roncali and Concha we may have occasion to speak hereafter,
but with this more modern chapter in the history of
the island the general reader is already conversant. It
appears almost incredible that an intelligent people, within
so short a distance of our southern coast, constantly visited
by the citizens of a free republic, and having the example
of successful revolt set them, by the men of the same race,
both in the north and south, weighed down by oppressions
almost without parallel, should never have aimed an effectual
blow at their oppressors. It would seem that the softness
of the unrivalled climate of those skies beneath which
it is luxury only to exist has unnerved them, and that the
effeminate spirit of the original inhabitants has descended
in retribution to the posterity of the <i>conquistadores</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>We have noticed in the preceding chapter, the anomaly
of the political condition of Cuba, increasing in prosperity
and civilization, imbibing liberal ideas from its geographical
position, and yet denied participation in the few shadowy
rights which the peninsular subjects of the enfeebled, distracted
and despotic parent monarchy enjoyed. We have
seen that, in later years, the adoption of more liberal ideas
by Spain produced no amelioration of the condition of the
colony; and that, on the other hand, a conformity to the
legal enactments of the mother country was punished as
treason. The result of the movement in the western department,
under Tacon, showed the Cubans that they had
nothing to hope from Spain, while the cruelties of General
O'Donnell increased the great discontent and despair of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
people. They now became satisfied that the hope of legal
reform was but a chimera; and a portion of the liberal party,
seeing no issue from their insufferable position but that of
revolution, boldly advocated the intervention of arms.</p>

<p>In 1848 a conspiracy was formed, in Cienfuegos and
Trinidad, with the purpose of throwing off the Spanish
yoke; but it was soon discovered, and crushed by the imprisonment
of various individuals in the central department.
The principal leader in this movement was General Narciso
Lopez, who succeeded in effecting his escape to the United
States, where he immediately placed himself in communication
with several influential and liberal Creoles, voluntary
and involuntary exiles, and established a correspondence
with the remnant of the liberal party yet at liberty on the
island, at the same time being aided in his plans by American
sympathy. The result of the deliberations of himself,
his correspondents and associates, was to try by the chances
of war for the liberation of Cuba. The disastrous result
of the expedition boldly undertaken for this purpose is
already well known.</p>

<p>Before sketching the principal features of this attempt,
we may be permitted to declare that, although we deplore
the fate of those of our countrymen who perished in the
adventure, though we readily concede that many of them
were actuated by lofty motives, still we must condemn their
action, and approve of the vigorous measures adopted by
the federal government to suppress that species of reckless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
adventure in which the <i>flibustiers</i> engaged. No amount
of sympathy with the sufferings of an oppressed people, no
combination of circumstances, no possible results, can excuse
the fitting out of a warlike expedition in the ports of a nation
against the possessions of a friendly power. The flag
which has waved unstained in peace and war over a free
land for more than three quarters of a century, must remain
spotless to the last. The hopes of every free heart in the
world are centred on our banner, and we must see to it
that no speck dims the dazzling lustre of its stars. No
degree of pride at the daring gallantry displayed by the
little handful of invaders of Cuba,&mdash;a gallantry inherited
from a brave ancestry who displayed their valor in the holiest
of causes,&mdash;must blind our eyes to the character of the adventure
which called it forth. We have tears for the fallen,
as brothers and men; but our conscience must condemn their
errors. While, individually, we should rejoice to see Cuba
free, and an integral portion of the Union, nothing will ever
induce us to adopt the atrocious doctrine that the ends justify
the means. But let us pass to a consideration of the
recent events in the records of the island.</p>

<p>Many of the leading patriots of the island undoubtedly
believed that the government of the United States would
second their efforts, if they should decide to unite themselves
to our republic, and boldly raise the banner of annexation.
A portion of the Cuban liberals adopted the motto, "Legal
Reform or Independence;" and these two factions of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
patriots did not henceforth act in perfect concert with each
other&mdash;a most fatal error to the interests of both. Time
and circumstances favored the war and annexation party;
the people were more than ever discontented with a government
which so oppressed them by a military despotism, and
by the enormous weight of the unjust taxation levied upon
them. We may here remark that the increase of the public
revenue, in the midst of so many elements of destruction
and ruin, can only be explained by the facility with which
the captain-general and royal stewards of the island invent
and arrange taxes, at their pleasure, and without a shadow
of propriety, or even precedent.</p>

<p>The <i>consuming</i> population of Cuba amounts to about
eight hundred thousand souls, and the total amount of taxes
and contributions of various forms is more than twenty-three
millions of dollars, in specie, per annum! It is hardly conceivable
that such a sum can be extorted from a population
whose wealth is precarious, and whose living is so costly.
With this revenue the government pays and supports an
army of over twenty thousand Peninsular troops in the
island; a vast number of employ&eacute;s, part of the clergy and
half the entire navy of Spain; the diplomatic corps in the
United States and Mexico; many officials of rank at home
in Spain; and the surplus is remitted to Spain, and spent
on the Peninsula on matters entirely foreign to the interests
of the island itself. A precious state of affairs!</p>

<p>The colored population of the island, both slaves and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
free, hated the Spaniards, for good reasons. The war
party, moreover, reckoned on the genius of a leader (Lopez)
trained to arms,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> equal in talents to any of the Spanish
generals, and beloved by the Spanish troops, as well as by
the Cuban population; and they relied, also, as we have
said, on the sympathy and ultimate aid of the United
States government. It is undoubtedly true that interested
parties in this country, prompted by mercenary motives,
increased this latter delusion by false reports; while the
Cuban conspirators, in turn, buoyed up the hopes of their
friends in the United States, by glowing accounts of the
patriotic spirit of the Creoles, and the extent of the preparations
they were making for a successful revolt. General
Lopez was actively arranging the means for an invasion,
when, in 1849, the United States government threw terror
into the ranks of the <i>flibustiers</i>, by announcing its determination
to enforce the sacredness of treaty stipulations.
This, for a time, frustrated the intended invasion.</p>

<p>In 1850 Lopez succeeded in effecting his first descent
upon the island. Having succeeded in baffling the vigilance
of the United States government, an expedition, consisting
of six hundred and fifty-two men, was embarked on board
two sailing-vessels and the steamer Creole, which conveyed
the general and his staff. In the beginning of July the
sailing-vessels left New Orleans, with orders to anchor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
at Contoy, one of the Mugeres Islands, on the coast of
Yucatan; the general followed, on the Creole, on the 7th.
At the time when the troops were embarked on the Creole
at Contoy, fifty-two of the number, who had been deceived
as to the nature of the expedition, refused to follow the general,
and were left on the island, with the intention of
returning to the United States in the two schooners. General
Lopez, after gaining some information from a fisherman
he encountered, resolved to land at Cardenas, on the northern
coast of the island, a hundred and twenty miles east of
Havana. He calculated that he could surprise and master
the garrison before the captain-general could possibly obtain
intelligence of his departure from New Orleans. His plan
was, to master the town, secure the authorities, intimidate
the Spaniards, and then, sustained by the moral influence
of victory, proceed to Matanzas by railroad.</p>

<p>Roncali, the captain-general, having received intelligence
of the landing at Contoy, despatched several ships-of-war in
that direction, to seize upon the general and his followers.
The latter, however, escaped the snare, and effected his
landing on the 19th. The garrison rushed to arms, and,
while a portion of the troops, after immaterial loss, retired
in good order to the suburbs, another, under the command
of Governor Ceruti, intrenched themselves in the government-house,
and gave battle to the invaders. After a
sharp skirmish, the building being set on fire, they surrendered;
the governor and two or three officers were made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
prisoners, and the soldiers consented to join the revolutionary
colors! Meanwhile, a body of one hundred invaders
seized upon the railroad station. The engines were fired
up, and the trains made ready to transport the invading
column to Matanzas.</p>

<p>But now came a pause. General Lopez, seeing that the
native population did not respond to his appeal, knew that
as soon as the news of the taking of Cardenas should be
circulated, he would be in a very critical situation. In
fact, the governor of Matanzas was soon on the march, at
the head of five hundred men. General Armero sailed from
Havana in the Pizarro, with a thousand infantry, while two
thousand five hundred picked troops, under the command of
General Count de Mirasol, were sent from Havana by the
railroad. Lopez saw that it would be madness to wait the
attack of these formidable columns, unsupported save by his
own immediate followers, and accordingly issued his orders
for the re&euml;mbarkation of his band, yet without relinquishing
the idea of landing on some more favorable point of the
island.</p>

<p>That portion of the garrison which, in the beginning of
the affair, had retreated to the suburbs, finding itself re&iuml;nforced
by a detachment of cavalry, attempted to cut off the
retreat of the invading general; but the deadly fire of the
latter's reserve decimated the horse, and the infantry, dismayed
at their destruction, took to rapid flight. The Creole
accordingly left the port without molestation, and before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the arrival of the government steam-frigate Pizarro. The
Spanish prisoners were landed at Cayo de Piedras, and
then Lopez, discovering the Pizarro in the distance, made
for the American continent, where the steamer was abandoned.
General Lopez was arrested by the authorities of
Savannah, but liberated again, in deference to the public
clamor. The Creole was seized, confiscated and sold. The
invaders disbanded; and thus this enterprise terminated.</p>

<p>A less enterprising and determined spirit than that of
General Lopez would have been completely broken by the
failure of his first attempts, the inactivity of the Cubans,
the hostility of the American government, and the formidable
forces and preparations of the Spanish officials. He
believed, however, that the Cubans were ripe for revolt;
that public opinion in the United States would nullify the
action of the federal government; and that, if he could once
gain a foothold in the island, the Spanish troops would
desert in such numbers to his banners that the preponderance
of power would soon be upon his side; and, with these
views, he once more busied himself, with unremitting industry,
to form another expedition.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the daring attack upon Cardenas, while it
demonstrated the determination of the invading party,
caused great anxiety in the mind of General Roncali.
True, he had at his disposal an army of more than twenty
thousand regular troops; but he was by no means sure of
their loyalty, and he therefore determined to raise a local<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
militia; but, as he suffered only Spaniards to enlist in it,
he aroused the jealousy of the Cuban-born inhabitants, and
thus swelled the force of opposition against the government.
General Lopez was informed of this fact, and based new
hopes upon the circumstance.</p>

<p>The Spanish government, having recalled Roncali, appointed
Don Jos&eacute; de la Concha captain-general of the
island, and the severity of his sway reminded the inhabitants
of the iron rule of Tacon. It was during his administration
that Lopez effected his second landing at Playitas, sixty
miles west of Havana. Several partial insurrections, which
had preceded this event, easily suppressed, as it appears, by
the Spanish government, but exaggerated in the accounts
despatched to the friends of Cuba in the United States,
inflamed the zeal of Lopez, and made him believe that the
time for a successful invasion had at length arrived.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> He
was so confident, at one time, of the determination and
ability of the Cubans alone to secure their independence,
that he wished to embark without any force, and throw himself
among them. It was this confidence that led him to
embark with only four hundred ill-armed men on board the
little steamer Pampero, on the 2d of August, 1851. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
force consisted mostly of Americans, but embraced forty-nine
Cubans in its ranks, with several German and Hungarian
officers; among the latter, General Pragay, one of the
heroes of the Hungarian revolution, who was second in
command to General Lopez on this occasion.</p>

<p>Many of the foreign officers spoke little, if any, English,
and mutual jealousies and insubordinations soon manifested
themselves in the little band. They were composed of
fierce spirits, and had come together without any previous
drilling or knowledge of each other. It was not the intention
of the commander-in-chief to sail direct for Cuba, but
to go to the neighborhood of St. John's river, Florida,
and get a supply of artillery, ammunition, extra arms, etc.
He then proposed to land somewhere in the central department,
where he thought he could get a footing, and rally a
formidable force, before the government troops could reach
him. But, when five days out, Lopez discovered that the
Pampero was short of coal; as no time could be spared to
remedy this deficiency, he resolved to effect a landing at
once, and send back the Pampero for re&iuml;nforcements and
supplies. At Key West he obtained favorable intelligence
from Cuba, which confirmed his previous plans. He learned
that a large portion of the troops had been sent to the eastern
department; and he accordingly steered for Bahia
Honda (deep bay). The current of the gulf, acting while
the machinery of the boat was temporarily stopped for
repairs, and the variation of the compass in the neighbor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>hood
of so many arms, caused the steamer to run out of her
course on the night of the 10th; and when the morning
broke, the invaders found themselves heading for the
narrow entrance of the harbor of Havana!</p>

<p>The course of the steamer was instantly altered; but
all on board momentarily expected the apparition of a war
steamer from the channel between the Moro and the Punta.
It appeared, afterwards, that the Pampero was signalized as
a strange steamer, but not reported as suspicious until
evening. The Pampero then made for the bay of Caba&ntilde;as;
but, just as she was turning into the entrance, a Spanish
frigate and sloop-of-war were seen at anchor, the first of
which immediately gave chase, but, the wind failing, the
frigate gave it up, and returned to the bay to send intelligence
of the expedition to Havana. The landing was finally
effected at midnight, between the 11th and 12th of August,
and the steamer was immediately sent off to the United
States for further re&iuml;nforcements. As it was necessary to
obtain transportation for the baggage, General Lopez
resolved to leave Col. Crittenden with one hundred and
twenty men to guard it, and with the remainder of the
expedition to push on to Las Pozas, a village about ten
miles distant, whence he could send back carts and horses
to receive it. Among the baggage were four barrels of
powder, two of cartridges, the officers' effects, including the
arms of the general, and the flag of the expedition. From<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the powder and arms they should not have separated, but
have divided that, against contingency.</p>

<p>In the mean time, seven picked companies of Spanish
troops of the line had been landed at Bahia Honda, which
force was strengthened by contingents drawn from the
neighborhood. The march of the invading band to Las
Pozas was straggling and irregular. On reaching the village,
they found it deserted by the inhabitants. A few carts
were procured and sent back to Crittenden, that he might
advance with the baggage. Lopez here learned from a
countryman of the preparations making to attack him. It
was no portion of his plan to bring the men into action with
regular troops, in their present undisciplined state; he proposed
rather to take a strong position in the mountains, and
there plant his standard as a rallying-point, and await the
rising of the Cubans, and the return of the Pampero with
re&iuml;nforcements for active operations.</p>

<p>As soon as Lopez learned the news from Bahia Honda,
he despatched a peremptory order to Crittenden to hasten up
with the rear-guard, abandoning the heavy baggage, but
bringing off the cartridges and papers of the expedition.</p>

<p>But the fatal delay of Crittenden separated him forever
from the main body, only a small detachment of his comrades
(under Captain Kelly) ever reaching it. The next day,
while breakfast was being prepared for them, the soldiers of
the expedition were suddenly informed, by a volley from one
of the houses of the village, that the Spanish troops were upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
them. They flew to arms at once, and the Cuban company
dislodged the vanguard of the enemy, who had fired, at the
point of the bayonet, their captain, Oberto, receiving his
death-wound in the spirited affair. General Enna, a brave
officer, in command of the Spanish troops, made two charges
in column on the centre of the invaders' line, but was repulsed
by that deadly fire which is the pre&euml;minent characteristic
of American troops. Four men alone escaped
from the company heading the first column, and seventeen
from that forming the advance of the second column of attack.
The Spaniards were seized with a panic, and fled.</p>

<p>Lopez's force in this action amounted to about two hundred
and eighty men; the Spaniards had more than eight
hundred. The total loss of the former, in killed and
wounded, was thirty-five; that of the latter, about two
hundred men killed, and a large number wounded! The
invaders landed with about eighty rounds of cartridges
each; the Spanish dead supplied them with about twelve
thousand more; and a further supply was subsequently obtained
at Las Frias; the ammunition left with Crittenden
was never recovered. In the battle of Las Pozas, General
Enna's horse was shot under him, and his second in command
killed. The invaders lost Colonel Downman, a brave
American officer; while General Pragay was wounded, and
afterwards died in consequence. Though the invaders fired
well and did terrible execution, they could not be prevailed
upon to charge the enemy, and gave great trouble to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
officers by their insubordination. The night after the battle,
Captain Kelly came up with forty men, and announced
that the Spanish troops had succeeded in dividing the rear-guard,
and that the situation of Crittenden was unknown.
It was not until some days afterwards that it was ascertained
that Crittenden's party, attempting to leave the island in
launches, had been made prisoners by a Spanish man-of-war.
They were taken to Havana, and brutally shot at the
castle of Atares.</p>

<p>About two o'clock on the 14th of August, the expedition
resumed its march for the interior, leaving behind their
wounded, who were afterwards killed and mutilated by the
Spaniards. The second action with the Spanish troops occurred
at the coffee-plantation of Las Frias, General Enna
attacking with four howitzers, one hundred and twenty cavalry,
and twelve hundred infantry. The Spanish general
attacked with his cavalry, but they were met by a deadly fire,
thrown into utter confusion, and forced to retreat, carrying
off the general mortally wounded. The panic of the cavalry
communicated itself to the infantry, and the result was
a complete rout. This was the work of about two hundred
muskets; for many of Lopez's men had thrown away their
arms on the long and toilsome march.</p>

<p>The expedition, however, was too weak to profit by their
desperate successes, and had no means of following up these
victories. Plunging into the mountains, they wandered
about for days, drenched with rain, destitute of food or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
proper clothing, until despair at last seized them. They separated
from each other, a few steadfast comrades remaining
by their leader. In the neighborhood of San Cristoval,
Lopez finally surrendered to a party of pursuers. He was
treated with every indignity by his captors, though he submitted
to everything with courage and serenity. He was
taken in a steamer from Mariel to Havana.</p>

<p>Arrived here, he earnestly desired to obtain an interview
with Concha, who had been an old companion-in-arms with
him in Spain; not that he expected pardon at his hands,
but hoping to obtain a change in the manner of his death.
His soul shrank from the infamous <i>garrotte</i>, and he aspired
to the indulgence of the <i>cuatro tiros</i> (four shots). Both
the interview and the indulgence were refused, and he was
executed on the first of September, at seven o'clock in the
morning, in the Punta, by that mode of punishment which
the Spaniards esteem the most infamous of all. When he
landed at Bahia Honda, he stooped and kissed the earth,
with the fond salutation, "<i>Querida Cuba</i>" (dear Cuba)!
and his last words, pronounced in a tone of deep tenderness,
were, "<i>Muero por mi amada Cuba</i>" (I die for my beloved
Cuba).<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The remainder of the prisoners who fell into the hands
of the authorities were sent to the Moorish fortress of Ceu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>ta;
but Spain seems to have been ashamed of the massacre
of Atares, and has atoned for the ferocity of her colonial
officials by leniency towards the misguided men of the expedition,
granting them a pardon.</p>

<p>At present it may be said that "order reigns in Warsaw,"
and the island is comparatively quiet in the presence
of a vast armed force. To Concha have succeeded
Canedo and Pezuelas, but no change for the better has taken
place in the administration of the island. Rigorous to the
native population, insolent and overbearing to foreigners,
respecting no flag and regarding no law, the captains-general
bear themselves as though Spain was still a first-rate power
as of yore, terrible on land, and afloat still the mistress of
the sea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>Cuba is at present politically in a critical and alarming
condition, and the most intelligent natives and resident foreigners
live in constant dread of a convulsion more terrific
and sanguinary than that which darkened the annals of St.
Domingo. Those best informed of the temper, designs and
position of Spain, believe in the existence of a secret treaty
between that country, France and England, by which the
two latter powers guarantee to Spain her perpetual possession
of the island, on condition of her carrying out the
favorite abolition schemes of the British government, and
Africanizing the island. Spain, it is supposed, unable to
stand alone, and compelled to elect between the loss of her
colony and subserviency to her British ally, has chosen of
the two evils that which wounds her pride the least, and is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
best calculated to secure the interests of monarchical Europe.
All the recent measures of the Captain-general
Pezuela are calculated to produce the conviction that the
Africanization of Cuba has been resolved upon; and, if his
alarming proclamation of the third of May has been somewhat
modified by subsequent proclamations and official
declarations, it is only because the Spanish government
lacks the boldness to unmask all its schemes, while the
Eastern war prevents France and Great Britain from sending
large armaments to Cuba to support it; and because the
national vessels and troops destined to swell the government
forces in the island have not all arrived. But for the existence
of the war in the East, the manifestoes of the captain-general
would have been much more explicit. As it is,
they are sufficiently bold and menacing.</p>

<p>A peaceful solution to the question of Cuba, by its sale to
the United States, is not regarded as probable by the best-informed
Creoles. They say that, even if the queen were
disposed to sell the island, it would be impossible to obtain
the consent of the Cortes. The integrity of the Spanish
domain, including all the islands, is protected by legal enactment;
and it would require the abrogation of a fundamental
law before it could be consummated.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Now, the
Spanish subjects well understand that they would not be
likely to be gainers by the sale of Cuba, however large a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
sum the United States might be willing to pay for it, while
the monopoly to trade, the bestowal of lucrative insular
offices on Spaniards alone, and other incidental advantages,
give them a direct interest in the maintenance of the present
order of things. Those who take this view of the
question say that if Spain has not promptly rejected the
overtures supposed to have been made by our minister at
Madrid, this delay indicates only a conscious weakness, and
not any hesitation of purpose. It is simply a diplomatic
trick&mdash;a temporizing policy. Why, they ask, if Spain had
any idea of parting with the island, would she be making
naval and military preparations on a grand and costly scale,
at home, while in the island she is making large levies, and
enrolling colored troops, not as militia, as the government
has falsely given out, but as regulars? We are reluctant
to abandon the hope of our purchasing the island, but candor
compels us to state the plausible arguments of those
who assert that no success can possibly attend the plan for
its peaceable acquisition.</p>

<p>Within a brief space of time, the administration of General
Pezuela has been signalized by measures of great significance
and importance: The decree of the third of May;
the order for the registration of slaves introduced into the
island in violation of the treaty of 1817; the decree freeing
more than fifteen thousand <i>emancipados</i> in the space
of a fortnight; that of May 25th, enrolling and arming
negroes and mulattoes; the project for importing negroes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
and mulattoes from Africa, under the name of free apprentices;
the institution of free schools for the instruction of
the blacks, while the whites are abandoned to their own resources;
and, finally, the legalization of the intermarriages
of blacks and whites, which last measure has actually been
carried into effect, to the indignation of the Creoles,&mdash;all
these measures show the determination of the Spanish government
to bring about the emancipation of slavery, and the
social equalization of the colored and white population, that
it may maintain its grasp upon the island, under penalty of
a war of races, which could only terminate in the extinction
of the whites, in case of a revolutionary movement.</p>

<p>The proclamation of the third of May, alluded to above,
and disclosing some of the abolition plans of the government,
produced a startling sensation. In it the captain-general
said: "It is time for the planter to substitute
for the rapid but delusive advantages derived from the sale
of human flesh, safer profits, more in harmony with civilization,
religion and morals;" and that "the time had come
to make the life of the slave sweeter than that of the white
man who labors under another name in Europe." The
proclamation, coupled with that conferring exclusive educational
advantages on colored persons, roused even the
Spaniards; some of the wealthiest and most influential of
whom held secret meetings to discuss the measures to be
adopted in such a crisis, in which it was resolved to withhold
all active aid from the government, some going so far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
as to advocate the making of common cause with the
Creoles. The mere hint of a fusion between the Spaniards
and Creoles, whom it has been the policy of the colonial
government to alienate from each other, was sufficient to excite
the fears of the captain-general; and accordingly, on the
31st of May, he published a sort of explanatory manifesto,
designed to allay the alarm of the Spaniards, and conflicting,
in several points, with that of the 3d. "Her Majesty's
government," says the document of the 31st, "is well
aware that the unhappy race (the Africans), once placed
among civilized men, and protected by the religion and the
great laws of our ancestors, is, in its so-called slavery, a
thousand times happier than other European classes, whose
liberty is only nominal." If this assertion were true, what
becomes of the famous declaration, in the former proclamation,
that the time had arrived to make the life of the slave
happier than of the white European laborer? If this assertion
were true, that "good time" had not only arrived, but
passed away, and his measures for the improvement of the
involuntary bondmen were actually supererogatory. The
owners of slaves are, moreover, assured that they shall not
be disturbed in the possession of their "legitimate property,"
and that the government will conciliate a due regard
for such property "with the sacred fulfilment of treaties."</p>

<p>It is very evident that the Creoles are doomed to be the
victims of Spanish duplicity. It is notorious that many
thousands of slaves have been introduced into the island, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
a series of years, with the connivance of the government,
when they had it in their power, at any time, to stop the
traffic altogether. The vigilance of the British cruisers was
baffled by the assurance that the Africans thus brought over
were apprentices, Spain never hesitating to deceive an ally;
and now, when compelled to keep faith, in a desperate
emergency, she betrays her own subjects, and throws the
penalty of her own bad faith on them.</p>

<p>A gentleman residing in Cuba writes: "No one can be
here, and watch the progress of things, without being convinced
that the ultimate object is the emancipation of the
slaves of the island transported subsequent to the treaty of
1820, which will comprise four-fifths of the whole number;
and no one who is an attentive observer, and with his ears
open, but must be satisfied that there is some other powerful
influence brought to bear on the subject besides Spain.
Take, for instance, the late order for the registration of the
slaves. The British consul openly says that the British
government have been, for a long time, urging the measure.
But it is not only in this, but in every other step taken,
that the British finger is constantly seen. A thousand corroborative
circumstances could be cited. Cuba is to-day
indebted to Russia for being free from this calamity. But
for the emperor's obstinacy, there would have been an English
and French fleet that would have enabled them to carry
out all the measures they have in contemplation."</p>

<p>With relation to the intermarriage of blacks and whites,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
our informant says, "Many marriages have been performed
since the date of the circular,"&mdash;that of the Bishop of
Havana to the curates of the island, by the authority of
the captain-general.</p>

<p>"The captain-general," says the same authority, "is
now exerting his influence for the admission of blacks into
the university, to prepare them for clerical orders. Should
this system be adopted, I fear it will lead to bad consequences.
It will, of course, be strenuously opposed. The
indignation of the Creoles has been difficult to restrain,&mdash;at
which you cannot be surprised, when their daughters,
wives and sisters, are daily insulted, particularly by those
in uniform. I fear a collision may take place. If once
commenced, it will be terrific."</p>

<p>The decree authorizing the celebration of marriages
between blacks and whites has probably produced more
indignation among the Creoles than any other official acts
of the captain-general. It was directed to the bishop in
the form of a circular, and issued on the 22d of May. On
the 29th of the same month, the bishop transmitted copies
of it to all the curates within his jurisdiction; and, as we
have seen, many of these incongruous marriages have been
already solemnized. Notwithstanding these notorious and
well-authenticated facts, the official organ of the government,
the <i>Diario de la Marina</i>, had the effrontery to
publish a denial of the transaction, asserting it to be mere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
idle gossip, without the slightest foundation, and ridiculing
the idea in a tone of levity and <i>persiflage</i>.</p>

<p>This may teach us how little dependence is to be placed
on the declarations of the Spanish officials; and we shall
be prepared to receive with incredulity the denial, in the
name of the queen, of the existence of a treaty with England,
having for its base the abolition of slavery, as a reward
for British aid in preserving Cuba to Spain. The captain-general
says that she relies not on foreign aid to maintain
her rights, but on her powerful "navy and disciplined
army; on the loyalty of the very immense (<i>inmensisima</i>)
majority of her vigorous native citizens (Creoles); on the
strength imparted to the good by the defence of their
hearths, their laws and their God; and on the hurricanes
and yellow fever for the enemy."</p>

<p>"Here," writes a Cuban gentleman, commenting on the
above declaration, "we must make a pause, and remark, <i>en
passant</i>, that the name of her majesty thus invoked, far
from giving force to the denial, weakens it greatly; for we
all know the value of the royal word, particularly that of
her majesty Isabella II. In her name a full pardon was
offered to Armenteros and his associates, who raised the cry
of independence in Trinidad, and this document effected the
purpose for which it was designed. Armenteros and the
others, who placed reliance in the royal word, were, some
of them, shot, and the rest deported to African dungeons.
No reliance can be placed on the loyalty of the vast major<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>ity
of the vigorous citizens (unless the negroes alone are
comprehended under this phrase), when the whites are
deprived of arms for the defence of their country, and men
are fined five pesos for carrying canes of a larger size than
can be readily introduced into a gun-barrel, and free people
of color are alone admitted into the ranks of the troops.
The Cubans are not relied upon, since, to prevent their joining
Lopez, all the roads were blockaded, and everybody
found on them shot; and the immense number of exiles
does not prove the majority which favors the government to
be so prodigious.</p>

<p>"The value of the powerful navy and well-trained army
of the island was shown in the landing of Lopez, and the
victories that three hundred men constantly obtained over
an army of seven thousand, dispersing only when ammunition
failed them. Hurricanes and the yellow fever are most
melancholy arms of defence; and, if they only injured the
enemy, the Spaniards, who are as much exposed as other
Europeans to the fatal influence, would be the true enemies
of Cuba."</p>

<p>The following remarks on the present condition and prospects
of the island are translated from a letter written by an
intelligent Creole, thoroughly conversant with its affairs:</p>

<p>"The whites tremble for their existence and property;
no one thinks himself secure; confidence has ceased, and
with it credit; capitalists have withdrawn their money from
circulation; the banks of deposit have suspended their dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>counts;
premiums have reached a fabulous point for the
best of paper. The government was not ignorant that this
would be the result, and prepared to get out of the momentary
crisis by the project of a bank,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> published in the
<i>Gaceta</i> of the 4th (May); but the most needy class, in the
present embarrassed circumstances, is that of the planters;
and it is necessary, to enable them to fulfil their engagements,
that their notes should be made payable at the end
of the year,&mdash;that is, from harvest to harvest,&mdash;and not
at the end of six months, as provided for in the regulations.
But it matters not; we are pursuing the path which will
precipitate us into the abyss, if instantaneous and efficacious
help does not come to save the island from the imminent
ruin which threatens it.</p>

<p>"The cause of the liberty of nations has always perished
in its cradle, because its defenders have never sought to
deviate from legal paths,&mdash;because they have followed the
principles sanctioned by the laws of nations; while despots,
always the first to exact obedience to them when it suited
their convenience, have been the first to infringe them when
they came into collision with their interests. Their alliances
to suppress liberty are called <i>holy</i>, and the crimes
they commit by invading foreign territories, and summoning
foreign troops to their aid to oppress their own vassals, are
sacred duties, compliances with secret compacts; and, if the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
congresses, parliaments and Cortes of other nations, raise
the cry to Heaven, they answer, the government has protested,&mdash;acts
have been performed without their sanction,&mdash;there
is no remedy,&mdash;they are acts accomplished.</p>

<p>"An act accomplished will shortly be the abolition of
slavery in Cuba; and the tardy intervention of the United
States will only have taken place when its brilliant constellation
lights up the vast sepulchre which will cover the
bodies of her sons, sacrificed to the black race as a reward
for their sympathies with American institutions, and the
vast carnage it will cost to punish the African victors.
What can be done to-day without great sacrifices to help
the Cubans, to-morrow cannot be achieved without the
effusion of rivers of blood, and when the few surviving
Cubans will curse an intervention which, deaf to their cries,
will only be produced by the cold calculations of egotism.
Then the struggle will not be with the Spaniards alone.
The latter will now accede to all the claims of the cabinet
at Washington, by the advice of the ambassadors of France
and England, to advance, meanwhile, with surer step to
the end,&mdash;to give time for the solution of the Eastern question,
and for France and England to send their squadrons
into these waters. Well may they deny the existence of
secret treaties; this is very easy for kings, as it will be
when the case of the present treaty comes up, asserting that
the treaty was posterior to their negative, or refusing explanations
as inconsistent with their dignity. But we witness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
the realization of our fears; we see the Spanish government
imperturbably setting on foot plans which were thought to
be the delirium of excited imaginations; doing at once what
promised to be a gradual work; and hear it declared, by distinguished
persons, who possess the confidence of General
Pezuela, that the existence of the treaty is certain, and that
the United States will be told that they should have
accepted the offer made to become a party to it, in which
case the other two powers could not have adopted the
abolition scheme. But, supposing this treaty to have no
existence, the fact of the abolition of slavery is no less certain.
It is only necessary to read the proclamation of the
captain-general, if the last acts of the government be not
sufficiently convincing. The result to the island of Cuba
and to the United States is the same, either way. If the
latter do not hasten to avert the blow, they will soon find it
impossible to remedy the evil. In the island there is not a
reflecting man,&mdash;foreigner or native, Creole or European,&mdash;who
does not tremble for the future that awaits us, at a
period certainly not far remote."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>Having thus briefly glanced at the political story of
Cuba, let us now pass to a consideration of such peculiarities
of climate, soil and population, as would naturally interest a
stranger on visiting the island. The form, geographically
speaking, of Cuba, is quite irregular, and resembles the
blade of a Turkish scimeter slightly curved back, or approaching
the form of a long, narrow crescent. It stretches
away in this shape from east to west, throwing its western
end into a curve, as if to form an impregnable barrier to
the outlet of the Gulf of Mexico; and as if, at some ancient
period, it had formed a part of the American continent, and
had been severed on its north side from the Florida peninsula
by the wearing of the Gulf-stream, and from Yucatan,
on its south-western point, by a current setting into the gulf.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Its political position all concede to be of the most vital
importance to the United States; and this will be apparent
to any one, from the slightest inspection of the map.</p>

<p>It is the most westerly of the West Indian isles, and,
compared with the rest, has nearly twice as much superficial
extent of territory. Its greatest extent, from east to west, is
about six hundred miles; its narrowest part, twenty-two
miles. The circumference is about two thousand miles, containing
some thirty-two thousand square miles.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The narrow
form of the island, and the Cordillera chain of mountains,
which divides it throughout its whole length, leave a
very limited course for its rivers and streams; and consequently
these in the rainy season become torrents, and
during the rest of the year are nearly dried up. Those
that sustain themselves throughout the year are well stocked
with delicate and finely-flavored fish.</p>

<p>Probably no place on the earth has a finer or more desirable
climate than has the main portion of Cuba;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> with
the clear atmosphere of the low latitudes, no mist, the sun
seldom obscured, and the appearance of the stars and
sky at night far brighter and more beautiful than at the
north.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The atmosphere does not seem to lose its transpar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>ency
with the departure of day. Sunset is ever remarkable
for its soft, mellow beauty here, and the long twilight that
follows it. For many years the island has been the resort
of the northern invalid in search of health, especially of
those laboring under pulmonary affections; the soft, soothing
power of the climate having a singularly healing influence,
as exercised in the balmy trade-winds.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The climate so
uniformly soft and mild, the vegetation so thriving and
beautiful, the fruits so delicious and abundant, seem to give
it a character almost akin to that we have seen described in
tales of fairy land.</p>

<p>The declining health of a beloved companion was the
motive which induced the author of these pages to visit the
delightful climate of Cuba, with the hope that its genial
and kindly influence might revive her physical powers; nor
were these hopes disappointed; for, transplanted from the
rough climate of our own New England, immediate and
permanent improvement was visible. To persons in the
early stages of pulmonary complaints the West Indies hold
forth great promise of relief; and, at the period when invalid
New Englanders most require to avoid their own homes,
namely, during the prevailing east winds of April, May and
June, the island of Cuba is in the glory of high summer,
and enjoying the healthiest period of its yearly returns.
After the early part of June, the unacclimated would do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
well to take passage up the gulf to New Orleans, and come
gradually north with the advancing season. From the
proximity of Cuba in the north-western parts to our own
continent, the climate is variable, and a few hundred feet
above the level of the sea ice is sometimes formed, but snow
never falls upon the island, though it is occasionally visited
in this region by hail storms. In the cities and near the
swamps, the yellow fever, that scourge of all hot climates,
prevails from the middle of June to the last of October;
but in the interior of the island, where the visitor is at a
wholesome distance from humidity and stagnant water, it is
no more unhealthy than our own cities in summer. It is
doubtful if Havana, even in the fever season, is as unhealthy
as New Orleans during the same period of the year.</p>

<p>The principal cities of the island are Havana, with a
population of about two hundred thousand; Matanzas,
twenty-five thousand; Puerto Principe, fourteen thousand;
Santiago de Cuba, thirty thousand; Trinidad, thirteen thousand;
St. Salvador, eight thousand; Manzanilla, three
thousand; Cardenas, Nuevitas, Sagua la Grande, Mariel,
etc. etc. Cuba abounds in fine large harbors; those of
Havana, Niepe and Nuevitas, are among the best. The bay
of Matanzas is also capacious; Cardenas and the roadstead
of Sagua la Grande have plenty of water for brigs and
schooners. Matanzas,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> though second to Puerto Principe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
in point of inhabitants, yet stands next to Havana in commercial
importance, and is said to be much healthier than
the capital. It is located in a valley in one of the most
fertile portions of the island, the city extending from the
flat sea-shore up to the picturesque and verdant heights by
which the town is surrounded in the form of an amphitheatre.
The fortifications are of rather a meagre character.
The custom-house is the most prominent building which
strikes the eye on approaching the city by water, and is an
elegant structure of stone, but one story high, built at the
early part of the present century. On the heights above
the city, the inhabitants have planted their country seats,
and from the bay the whole scene is most delightfully picturesque.
There are two fine churches in Matanzas, and a
second-class theatre, cock-pit, etc. Statistics show the custom-house
receipts of the port to exceed the large sum of a
million and a half dollars annually. Besides the railroad
leading to Havana, there is another leading to the interior
and bearing southward, of some thirty or forty miles in
length. On all the Cuban railroads you ride in American-built
cars, drawn by American-built engines, and conducted
by American engineers. The back country from Matanzas
is rich in sugar and coffee plantations.</p>

<p>Puerto Principe is the capital of the central department
of the island, and is situated in the interior. The trade of
the place, from the want of water-carriage, is inconsiderable,
and bears no proportion to the number of inhabitants. What<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
ever portion of the produce of Puerto Principe and its immediate
neighborhood is exported, must find its way first to
Nuevitas, twelve and a half leagues distant, from whence
it is shipped, and from whence it receives in return its foreign
supplies. It is situated about one hundred and fifty miles from
Havana. Its original locality, when founded by Velasquez,
was Nuevitas, but the inhabitants, when the place was
feeble in numbers and strength, were forced to remove to
this distance inland, to avoid the fierce incursions of the
Buccaneers, who thronged the coast.</p>

<p>Santiago de Cuba has a noble harbor, and is defended by
a miniature Moro Castle, being a well-planned fortress after
the same style, and known as <i>El Moro</i>. This city was
founded in 1512, and is the capital of the eastern department
of the island, but has at various times suffered severely
from earthquakes, and within a couple of years was visited
by the cholera, which swept off some five or six thousand of its
population in about the same number of weeks. Santiago,
though it now presents many features of decay, and its
cathedral is closed for fear of disaster occurring if it should
be occupied, is yet the third city on the island in a commercial
point of view. The immediate neighborhood of the
city being mountainous and somewhat sterile, produces little
sugar, but the many fine coffee estates, and several vast copper
mines of uncomputed extent and value, which have
been worked by English companies, give it much importance.
It is two hundred and thirty leagues from Havana,
on the south coast.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>Trinidad, situated about a league from Casilda, on the
south coast, and ninety miles from Havana, is probably
one of the healthiest and pleasantest locations for invalids
on the island. It lies at the base of a ridge of mountains
that protect it from the north wind, and is free from all
humidity, with that great blessing, good water, at hand, an
article which unfortunately is very scarce in Cuba.</p>

<p>Our first view of Moro Castle was gained from the quarter-deck,
after a fifteen days' voyage; it was just as the sun
was dipping into the sea, too late for us to enter the harbor,
for the rules of the port are rigorously observed, and we
were obliged to stand off and on through the night. At
early morning our jack was set at the fore as a signal for a
pilot, and at noon we had answered the rough peremptory
hail from the castle, and dropped anchor in the safe and
beautiful harbor of the capital. The scene was absorbingly
interesting to a stranger. Around us floated the flags of
many nations, conspicuous among which were the gallant
stars and stripes. On the one side lay the city, on a low,
level plain, while the hills that make the opposite side of
the harbor presented a beautiful picture of the soft green
sward and the luxuriant verdure that forms the constant
garb of the tropics.</p>

<p>As Paris is said to be France, so is Havana Cuba, and its
history embraces in no small degree that of all the island,
being the centre of its talent, wealth and population. Every
visible circumstance proclaims the great importance of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
city, even to the most casual observer. Moro Castle<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> frowning
over the narrow entrance of the harbor, the strong
battery answering to it on the opposite point, and known as
La Punta, the long range of cannon and barracks on the
city side, the powerful and massive fortress of the Cabanas<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
crowning the hill behind the Moro, all speak unitedly of the
immense importance of the place. Havana is the heart of
Cuba, and will never be yielded unless the whole island be
given up; indeed, the possessors of this strong-hold command
the whole Spanish West Indies. The bay, shaped like an
outspread hand, the wrist for the entrance, is populous with
the ships of all nations,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and the city, with its 200,000
inhabitants, is a depot of wealth and luxury. With an
enormous extent of public buildings, cathedrals, antique
and venerable churches and convents, with the palaces of
nobles and private gentlemen of wealth, all render this capital
of Cuba probably the richest place for its number of
square rods in the world.</p>

<p>Beside the Royal University of Havana, a medical and
law school, and chairs on all the natural sciences, it contains
many other institutions of learning. It is true that, in spite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
of their liberal purpose and capability, there is a blight, as
it were, hanging over them all. Pupils enlist cautiously,
suffer undue restraint, and in spite of themselves seem to
feel that there is an unseen influence at work against the
spirit of these advantages. Among the schools are a Royal
Seminary for girls, a free school of sculpture and painting,
a mercantile school, also free, with many private institutions
of learning, of course not to be compared in ability or general
advantages to like institutions with us. There is a fine
museum of Natural History, and just outside the city walls
a very extensive botanical garden. No one, even among
the islanders, who would be supposed to feel the most pride
in the subject, will for a moment deny, however, that the
means for education are very limited in Cuba. An evidence
of this is perceptibly evinced by the fact that the
sons of the planters are almost universally sent abroad,
mostly to this country, for educational purposes. An order
was not long since promulgated, by direction of the home
government, in which the inhabitants are forbidden to send
their children to the United States, for the purpose of education.
A bold, decided order.</p>

<p>Of course the reason for this is quite apparent, and is
openly acknowledged in Havana, viz:&mdash;that these youths,
during their residence here, adopt liberal ideas and views of
our republican policy, which become fixed principles with
them; nor is there any doubt of this being the case, for
such students as have thus returned, unhesitatingly (among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
friends) avow their sentiments, and most ardently express a
hope for Cuban independence; and this class, too, upon the
island are far more numerous than might at first be supposed.
Those who have been educated in France, Germany, and
England, seem at once to imbibe the spirit of those youths
who have returned from the United States, and long before
there was any open demonstration relative to the first Lopez
expedition, these sons of the planters had formed themselves
into a secret society, which is doubtless still sustained, with
the avowed purpose of exercising its ability and means to
free Cuba, sooner or later, from the Spanish yoke.</p>

<p>The city of Havana is surrounded by a high wall and
ditch, and its gates are always strictly guarded by soldiery,
no stranger being permitted to pass unchallenged. The
streets, which are extremely narrow, are all Macadamized,
and cross each other at right angles, like those of Philadelphia
and some other American cities. There are no sidewalks,
unless a narrow line of flag-stones which are level
with the surface of the street may be so called. Indeed, the
people have little use for sidewalks, for they drive almost
universally about town in place of walking, being thus
borne about in that peculiar vehicle, a volante. A woman
of respectability is never seen on foot in the streets, and
this remark, as singular as it may sound to our Broadway
and Washington-street belles, is applicable even to the humblest
classes; unless, indeed, it be the fruit women from the
country, with their baskets richly laden upon their heads,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
while they cry the names of their tempting burdens in the
long drawling Spanish style.</p>

<p>The architecture of the city houses is exceedingly heavy,
giving to them an appearance of great age. They are constructed
so as almost universally to form squares in their
centres, which constitutes the only yard which the house
can have, and upon which the lofty arches of the corridor
look down. The lower story is always occupied as storeroom,
kitchen, and stable, (think of a suite of drawing-rooms
over a stable!) while the universal volante blocks up in
part the only entrance to the house. From this inner
court-yard a wide flight of steps leads to the second story,
from the corridor of which all the rooms open, giving them
an opening front and rear on two sides at least. As peculiar
as this mode of building may seem, it is nevertheless
well adapted to the climate, and one becomes exceedingly
well satisfied with the arrangement.</p>

<p>An air of rude grandeur reigns over all the structure,
the architecture being mainly Gothic and Saracenic. The
rooms are all lofty, and the floors are stuccoed or tiled,
while the walls and ceilings are frequently ornamented in
fresco, the excellence of the workmanship of course varying
in accordance with the owner's or occupant's means, and
his ability to procure an artist of high or <i>mediocre</i> talent.
But the most striking peculiarity of the town house in
Cuba, is the great care taken to render it safe against
assault. Every man's house is literally his castle here,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
each accessible window being barricaded with iron bars,
while large massive folding doors secure the entrance to the
house, being bullet proof and of immense strength. No
carpets are seen here, and from the neighboring Isle of
Pines, which lies off the southern shore of Cuba, a thick
slate is found, also marble and jasper of various colors,
which are cut in squares, and form the general material for
floors in the dwelling-houses. The heat of the climate renders
carpets, or even wooden floors, quite insupportable, and
they are very rarely to be found.</p>

<p>We have said that the Creole ladies never stir abroad
except in the national volante, and whatever their domestic
habits may be, they are certainly, in this respect, good <i>house-keepers</i>.
A Cuban belle could never, we fancy, be made
to understand the pleasures of that most profitless of all
employments, spinning street-yarn. While our ladies are
busily engaged in sweeping the sidewalks of Chestnut-street
and Broadway with their silk flounces, she wisely leaves
that business to the gangs of criminals who perform the
office with their limbs chained, and a ball attached to preserve
their equilibrium. It is perhaps in part owing to these
habits that the feet of the Cuban se&ntilde;orita are such a marvel
of smallness and delicacy, seemingly made rather for ornament
than for use. She knows the charm of the <i>petit pied
bien chauss&eacute;</i> that delights the Parisian, and accordingly, as
you catch a glimpse of it, as she steps into the volante, you
perceive that it is daintily shod in a French slipper, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
sole of which is scarcely more substantial in appearance than
writing paper.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The feet of the Havana ladies are made for ornament
and for dancing. Though with a roundness of figure that
leaves nothing to be desired in symmetry of form, yet they
are light as a sylph, clad in muslin and lace, so languid
and light that it would seem as if a breeze might waft them
away like a summer cloud. They are passionately fond of
dancing, and tax the endurance of the gentlemen in their
heroic worship of Terpsichore. Inspired by the thrilling
strains of those Cuban airs, which are at once so sweet and
brilliant, they glide or whirl through the mazes of the
dance hour after hour, until daylight breaks upon the
scene of fairy revel. Then, "exhausted but not satiated,"
they betake themselves to sleep, to dream of the cadences of
some Cuban Strauss, and to beat time in imagination to the
lively notes, and to dream over the soft words and winning
glances they have exchanged.</p>

<p>Beautiful as eastern houris, there is a striking and endearing
charm about the Cuban ladies, their very motion being
replete with a native grace; every limb elastic and supple.
Their voices are sweet and low, "an excellent thing in woman,"
and the subdued tone of their complexions is relieved
by the arch vivacity of night-black eyes that alternately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
swim in melting lustre or sparkle in expressive glances.
Their costume is never ostentatious, though costly; the
most delicate muslin, the finest linen, the richest silk, the
most exquisitely made satin shoes,&mdash;these, of course, render
their chaste attire exceedingly expensive. There are no
"strong-minded" women among them, nor is it hardly
possible to conceive of any extremity that could induce
them to get up a woman's right convention&mdash;a suspension
of fans and volantes might produce such a phenomenon, but
we very much doubt it.</p>

<p>The Creole ladies lead a life of decided ease and pleasure.
What little work they do is very light and lady-like, a little
sewing or embroidery; the bath and the <i>siesta</i> divide the
sultry hours of the day. They wait until nearly sunset
for the drive in the dear volante, and then go to respond by
sweet smiles to the salutations of the <i>caballeros</i> on the
Paseos, and after the long twilight to the Plaza de Armas,
to listen to the governor's military band, and then perhaps
to join the mazy dance. Yet they are capable of deep and
high feeling, and when there was a prospect of the liberation
of the island, these fair patriots it will be remembered gave
their most precious jewels and ornaments as a contribution
to the glorious cause of liberty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>On no occasion is the difference between the manners of a
Protestant and Catholic community so strongly marked as
on the Sabbath. In the former, a sober seriousness stamps
the deportment of the people, even when they are not engaged
in devotional exercises; in the latter, worldly pleasures
and religious exercises are pursued as it were at the
same time, or follow each other in incongruous succession.
The Parisian flies from the church to the railway station,
to take a pleasure excursion into the country, or passes with
careless levity from St. Genevieve to the Jardin Mabille;
in New Orleans, the Creole, who has just bent his knee before
the altar, repairs to the French opera, and the Cuban from
the blessing of the priest to the parade in the Plaza. Even
the Sunday ceremonial of the church is a pageant; the
splendid robe of the officiating priest, changed in the course<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of the offices, like the costumes of actors in a drama; the
music, to Protestant ears operatic and exciting; the clouds
of incense that scatter their intoxicating perfumes; the chants
in a strange tongue, unknown to the mass of worshippers;&mdash;all
these give the services a holiday and carnival character.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Far be it from us to charge these congregations with any
undue levity; many a lovely Creole kneels upon the marble
floor, entirely estranged from the brilliant groups around
her, and unconscious for the time of the admiration she
excites; many a <i>caballero</i> bows in reverence, forgetful, for
the time being, of the bright eyes that are too often the
load-star of attraction to the church; and there are very
many who look beyond the glittering symbols to the great
truths and the great Being they are intended to typify.
But we fear that a large portion of the community who
thus worship, attach more importance to the representation
than to the principles or things represented. The impression
made by the Sabbath ceremonies of the church strikes
us as evanescent, and as of such a character as to be at once
obliterated by the excitement of the worldly pleasures that
follow. Still, if the Sabbath in Catholic countries be not
wholly devoted to religious observances, neither are the
week days wholly absorbed by business and pleasure. The
churches and chapels are always open, silently but elo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>quently
inviting to devotion; and it is much to be able to
step aside, at any moment, from the temptations, business
and cares of life, into an atmosphere of seclusion and religion.
The solemn quiet of an old cathedral on a week-day
is impressive from its very contrast with the tumult
outside.</p>

<p>Within its venerable walls the light seems chastened as it
falls through storied panes, and paints the images of Christian
saints and martyrs on the cold pavement of the aisles.
Who can tell how many a tempest-tossed soul has found
relief and strength from the ability to withdraw itself at
once from the intoxicating whirl of the world and expand in
prayer in one of these hospitable and ever open sanctuaries?
The writer is a firm Protestant, by education, by association
and feeling, but he is not so bigoted as not to see features
in the Catholic system worthy of commendation. Whether
the Catholic church has accomplished its mission, and exhausted
its means of good, is a question open to discussion,
but that in the past it has achieved much for the cause of
true religion cannot be denied. Through the darkest period
in the history of the world, it was the lamp that guided to
a higher civilization, and the bulwark of the people against
the crushing force of feudalism; and with all the objections
which it discovers to a Protestant eye, it still preserves many
beautiful customs.</p>

<p>The Sabbath in Havana breaks upon the citizens amid
the ringing of bells from the different convents and churches,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the firing of cannon from the forts and vessels, the noise of
trumpets, and the roll of the drum. Sunday is no day of
physical rest here. The stores are open as usual, the same
cries are heard in the streets, and the lottery tickets are
vended as ever at each corner. The individual who devotes
himself to this business rends the air with his cries of temptation
to the passing throng, each one of whom he earnestly
assures is certain to realize enormous pecuniary returns by
the smallest investment, in tickets, or portions of tickets,
which he holds in sheets, while he brandishes a huge pair
of scissors, ready to cut in any desired proportion. The
day proves no check to the omnipresent "organ grinders,"
the monkey shows, and other characteristic scenes. How
unlike a New England Sabbath is all this, how discordant
to the feelings of one who has been brought up amid our
Puritanic customs of the sacred day! And yet the people
of Havana seem to be impressed with no small degree of
reverence for the Catholic faith. The rough Montero from
the country, with his long line of loaded mules, respectfully
raises his panama with one hand, while he makes the sign
of the cross with the other, as he passes the church. The
calisero or postilion, who dashes by with his master in the
volante, does not forget, in his hurry, to bend to the pommel
of his saddle; and even the little negro slave children may
be observed to fold their arms across their breasts and remain
reverentially silent until they have passed its doors.</p>

<p>The city abounds in beautifully arranged squares, orna<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>mented
by that king of the tropical forest, the Royal Palm,
with here and there a few orange trees, surrounded by a
luxuriant hedge of limes. The largest and most beautiful
of these squares is the <i>Plaza de Armas</i>, fronting which is
the Governor's palace, and about which are the massive
stone barracks of the Spanish army. This square is surrounded
by an iron railing and divided into beautiful walks,
planted on either side with gaudy flowers, and shadowed by
oranges and palms, while a grateful air of coolness is diffused
around by the playing of a copious fountain into a large
stone basin, surmounted by a marble statue of Ferdinand.
Public squares, parks and gardens, are the lungs of great
cities, and their value increases as the population becomes
dense. Heap story upon story of costly marble, multiply
magazines and palaces, yet neglect to provide, in their midst,
some glimpse of nature, some opening for the light and
air of heaven, and the costliest and most sumptuous of cities
would prove but a dreary dwelling-place. The eye wearies,
in time, of the glories of art, but of the gifts of nature
never, and in public squares and gardens both may be happily
combined.</p>

<p>Human culture brings trees, shrubs and flowers to their
fullest development, fosters and keeps green the emerald
sward, and brings the bright leaping waters into the midst
of the graces of nature. Nowhere does a beautiful statue
look more beautiful than when erected in a framework of
deep foliage. These public squares are the most attractive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>features of cities. Take from London Hyde Park, from
Paris the Champs Elys&eacute;es and the Tuilleries gardens, the
Battery and the Park from New York, and the Common
from Boston, and they would be but weary wildernesses of
brick, stone and mortar. The enlightened corporation that
bestows on a young city the gift of a great park, to be enjoyed
in common forever, does more for posterity than if it
raised the most sumptuous columns and palaces for public
use or display.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">PLAZA DE ARMAS AND GOVERNOR&#39;S PALACE.</span>
</div>

<p>The Plaza de Armas of Havana is a living evidence of
this, and is the nightly resort of all who can find time to be
there, while the governor's military band performs always
from seven to nine o'clock. The Creoles call it "the poor
man's opera," it being free to all; every class resorts hither;
and even the ladies, leaving their volantes, sometimes walk
with husband or brother within the precincts of the Plaza.
We are told that "the man who has not music in his soul
is fit for treason, stratagem and spoils." It is undoubtedly
from motives of policy that the Havanese authorities provide
this entertainment for the people. How ungrateful it
would be to overthrow a governor whose band performs such
delightful polkas, overtures and marches; and yet, it requires
some circumspection for the band-master to select
airs for a Creole audience. It would certainly never do to
give them "Yankee Doodle;" their sympathies with the
"<i>Norte Americanos</i>" are sufficiently lively without any
such additional stimulus; and it is well for the authorities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
to have a care, for the power of national airs is almost incredible.
It was found necessary, in the times of the old
Bourbons, to forbid the performance of the "<i>Ranz des
Vaches</i>," because it so filled the privates of the Swiss
guards with memories of their native home that they deserted
in numbers. The Scotch air of "Lochaber no more"
was found to have the same effect upon the Highland regiments
in Canada; and we are not sure that "Yankee Doodle,"
performed in the presence of a thousand Americans
on the Plaza de Armas, would not secure the annexation of
the island in a fortnight.</p>

<p>The Creoles are passionately fond of music. Their favorite
airs, besides the Castilian ones, are native dances,
which have much sweetness and individuality of character.
They are fond of the guitar and flageolet, and are often
proficients in their use, as well as possessing fine vocal
powers. The voice is cultivated among the gentlemen as often
as with the ladies. Music in the open air and in the evening
has an invincible effect everywhere, but nowhere is its influence
more deeply felt than in a starry tropical night.
Nowhere can we conceive of a musical performance listened
to with more delightful relish than in the Plaza at Havana,
as discoursed by the governor's band, at the close of the
long tropical twilight.</p>

<p>In the immediate neighborhood of the Plaza, near the
rear of the governor's palace, is a superb confectionary,&mdash;really
one of the notabilities of the city, and only excelled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
by Taylor's saloon, Broadway, New York. It is called La
Dominica, and is the popular resort of all foreigners in
Havana, and particularly of Americans and Frenchmen. It
is capable of accommodating some hundreds of visitors at
a time, and is generally well filled every afternoon and evening.
In the centre is a large open court, paved with white
marble and jasper, and containing a fountain in the middle,
around which the visitors are seated. Probably no establishment
in the world can supply a larger variety of preserves,
bon-bons and confectionaries generally, than this, the
fruits of the island supplying the material for nearly a hundred
varieties of preserves, which the proprietor exports
largely to Europe and America, and has thereby accumulated
for himself a fortune.</p>

<p>Following the street on which is this famous confectionary,
one is soon brought to the city walls, and, passing outside,
is at once ushered into the Tacon Paseo, where all the beauty
and fashion of the town resort in the after part of the day.
It is a mile or more in length, beautifully laid out in wide,
clean walks, with myriads of tropical flowers, trees and
shrubs, whose fragrance seems to render the atmosphere
almost dense. Here the ladies in their volantes, and the
gentlemen mostly on foot, pass and repass each other in a
sort of circular drive, gayly saluting, the ladies with a coquettish
flourish of the fan, the gentlemen with a graceful
wave of the hand.</p>

<p>In these grounds is situated the famous Tacon Theatre.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
In visiting the house, you enter the first tier and parquette
from the level of the Paseo, and find the interior about
twice as large as any theatre in this country, and about
equal in capacity to Tripler Hall, New York, or the Music
Hall, Boston. It has five tiers of boxes, and a parquette
with seats, each separate, like an arm-chair, for six hundred
persons. The lattice-work in front of each box is
light and graceful, of gilt ornament, and so open that the
dresses and pretty feet of the se&ntilde;oras are seen to the best
advantage. The decorations are costly, and the frescoes and
side ornaments of the proscenium exceedingly beautiful. A
magnificent cut-glass chandelier, lighted with gas, and
numerous smaller ones extending from the boxes, give a
brilliant light to this elegant house. At the theatre the
military are always in attendance in strong force, as at all
gatherings in Cuba, however unimportant, their only perceptible
use, however, being to impede the passages, and
stare the ladies out of countenance. The only other noted
place of amusement is the Italian opera-house, within the
city walls, an oven-shaped building externally, but within
appropriately and elegantly furnished with every necessary
appurtenance.</p>

<p>No object in Havana will strike the visitor with more of
interest than the cathedral, situated in the Calle de Ignacio.
Its towers and pillared front of defaced and moss-grown
stone call back associations of centuries gone by. This
cathedral, like all of the Catholic churches, is elaborately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
ornamented with many fine old paintings of large size and
immense value. The entire dome is also decorated with
paintings in fresco. The chief object of interest, however,
and which will not fail to attract the attention, is a tablet
of marble inlaid in the wall at the right of the altar, having
upon its face the image of Christopher Columbus, and
forming the entrance to the tomb where rest the ashes of
this discoverer of a western world; here, too, are the iron

</div>

<p>The story of the great Genoese possesses a more thrilling
interest than any narrative which the imagination of
poet or romancer has ever conceived. The tales of the Arabian
Nights, with all their wealth of fancy, are insipid and
insignificant compared with the authentic narrative of the
adventures of the Italian mariner and his sublime discovery.
Familiar as we are with it from childhood, from the
greatness of the empire he gave to Christendom, the tale
has still a fascination, however often repeated, while the
visible memorials of his greatness and his trials revive all
our veneration for his intellect and all our interest in the
story of his career. His name flashes a bright ray over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
mental darkness of the period in which he lived, for men
generally were then but just awakening from the dark sleep
of the middle ages. The discovery of printing heralded
the new birth of the republic of letters, and maritime enterprise
received a vigorous impulse. The shores of the
Mediterranean, thoroughly explored and developed, had endowed
the Italian states with extraordinary wealth, and
built up a very respectable mercantile marine, considering
the period. The Portuguese mariners were venturing farther
and farther from the peninsula ports, and traded with
different stations on the coast of Africa.</p>

<p>But to the <i>west</i> lay what men supposed to be an illimitable
ocean, full of mystery, peril and death. A vague conception
that islands, hitherto unknown, might be met with
afar off on that strange wilderness of waters, like oases in
a desert, was entertained by some minds, but no one thought
of venturing in quest of them. Columbus alone, regarded
merely as a brave and intelligent seaman and pilot, conceived
the idea that the earth was spherical, and that the
East Indies, the great El Dorado of the century, might be
reached by circumnavigating the globe. If we picture to
ourselves the mental condition of the age, and the state of
science, we shall find no difficulty in conceiving the scorn
and incredulity with which the theory of Columbus was
received. We shall not wonder that he was regarded as a
madman or as a fool; we are not surprised to remember
that he encountered repulse upon repulse, as he journeyed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
wearily from court to court, and pleaded in vain for aid to
the sovereigns of Europe and wise men of the cloister. But
the marvel is that when gate after gate was closed against
him, when all ears were deaf to his patient importunities,
when day by day the opposition to his views increased, when,
weary and foot-sore, he was forced to beg a morsel of bread
and a cup of water for his fainting and famished boy, at
the door of a Spanish convent, his reason did not give way,
and his great heart did not break beneath its weight of disappointment.</p>

<p>But his soul was then as firm and steadfast as when,
launched in his frail caravel upon the ocean, he pursued
day after day, and night after night, amidst a discontented,
murmuring, and mutinous crew, his westward path over the
trackless waters. We can conceive of his previous sorrows,
but what imagination can form an adequate conception of
his hopefulness and gratitude when the tokens of the neighborhood
of land first greeted his senses; of his high enthusiasm
when the shore was discovered; of his noble rapture
when the keel of his bark grounded on the shore of San
Salvador, and he planted the royal standard in the soil, the
Viceroy and High Admiral of Spain in the New World!
No matter what chanced thereafter, a king's favor or a
king's displeasure, royal largesses or royal chains,&mdash;that
moment of noble exultation was worth a long lifetime of
trials. Such were our thoughts before the cathedral altar,
gazing on his consecrated tomb, and thus suggestive will the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
visitor be sure to find this memorial of the great captain
amid its sombre surroundings.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>It will be remembered that Columbus died in Valladolid,
in 1506. In 1513 his remains were transferred to Seville,
preparatory to their being sent, as desired in his will, to St.
Domingo. When that island was ceded to France, the
remains were delivered to the Spaniards. This was in 1796,
one hundred and three years after they had been placed
there; they were then brought with great pomp to Havana,
in a national ship, and were deposited in the cathedral in
the presence of all the high authorities. The church itself,
aside from this prominent feature of interest, is vastly attractive
from its ancient character and appearance, and one
lingers with mysterious delight and thoughtfulness among
its marble aisles and confessionals.</p>

<p>The wealth of the church and of the monks in Cuba was
formerly proverbial, but of late years the major portion of
the rich perquisites which they were so long permitted to
receive, have been diverted in their course, so as to flow into
the coffers of the crown. The priests at one time possessed
large tracts of the richest soil of the island, and their revenue
from these plantations was immense; but these lands
were finally confiscated by the government, and, with the
loss of their property, the power of the monks has also
declined, and they themselves diminished in numbers. Two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
of their large establishments, St. Augustine and St. Domingo,
have been converted into government storehouses, and
the large convent of San Juan de Dios is now used solely
for a hospital. Formerly the streets were thronged by
monks, but now they are only occasionally seen, with their
sombre dress and large shovel hats.</p>

<p>The character of this class of men has of former years
been a scandal to the island, and the stories that are told by
respectable people concerning them are really unfit for
print. They led lives of the most unlimited profligacy,
and they hesitated not to defy every law, moral or divine.
For a long period this existed, but Tacon and subsequent
governors-general, aroused to a sense of shame, made the
proper representations to the home government, and put a
stop to their excesses. Many persons traced the bad condition
of public morals and the increase of crime just previous
to Tacon's governorship directly to this ruling influence.</p>

<p>A fearful condition when those who assume to lead in
spiritual affairs proved the fountain-head of crime upon the
island, themselves the worst of criminals.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>One peculiarity which is certain to strike the stranger
from the first hour he lands upon the island, whether in
public or private houses, in the stores or in the streets, is
that the young slaves, of both sexes, under the age of eight
or ten years, are permitted to go about in a state of perfect
nudity; while the men of the same class, who labor in the
streets, wear only a short pair of pantaloons, without any
other covering to the body, thus displaying their brawny
muscles at every movement. This causes rather a shock to
the ideas of propriety entertained by an American; but it
is thought nothing of by the "natives." On the plantations
inland, the slaves of either sex wear but just enough
clothes to appear decently. The almost intolerable heat
when exposed to field-labor is the excuse for this, a broad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
palm-leaf hat being the only article that the negroes seem
to desire to wear in the field.</p>

<p>The Calle de Mercaderes, or the street of the merchants,
is the Broadway and Washington Street of Havana, and
contains many fine stores for the sale of dry goods, china,
jewelry, glass-ware, etc. The merchant here does not
designate his store by placing his own name on his sign,
but, on the contrary, adopts some fancy title, such as the
"America," the "Star," the "Bomb," "Virtue," and
the like; which titles are paraded in golden letters over the
doors. These tradesmen are, generally speaking, thorough
Jews in their mode of dealing, and no one thinks of paying
the first price asked by them for an article, as they usually
make allowances for being beaten down at least one half.
The ladies commonly make their purchases in the after
part of the day, stopping in their volantes at the doors of
the shops, from which the articles they desire to examine
are brought to them by the shopmen. No lady enters a
shop to make a purchase, any more than she would be found
walking in the streets.</p>

<p>There is no paper money known on the island, so that
all transactions at these stores must be consummated in
specie. The coin generally in use is the Spanish and
Mexican dollar, half and quarter dollars, pes&eacute;tas, or twenty-cent
pieces, and reals de plata, equal to our twelve-and-a-half
cent pieces, or York shillings. The gold coin is the
doubloon and its fractions. Silver is always scarce, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
held at a premium in Havana, say from two to five per cent.
As Cuba has no regular bank, the merchant draws on his
foreign credit altogether, each mercantile house becoming
its own sub-treasury, supplied with the largest and best of
iron safes. The want of some legitimate banking system is
severely felt here, and is a prominent subject of complaint
with all foreign merchants.</p>

<p>The Spanish government supports a large army on the
island, which is under the most rigid discipline, and in a
state of considerable efficiency. It is the policy of the
home government to fill the ranks with natives of old Spain,
in order that no undue sympathy may be felt for the Creoles,
or islanders, in case of insurrection or attempted revolution.
An order has recently been issued by Pezuela, the present
governor-general, for the enrolment of free blacks and
mulattoes in the ranks of the army, and the devotion of
these people to Spain is loudly vaunted in the captain-general's
proclamation. The enlistment of people of color in
the ranks is a deadly insult offered to the white population
of a slave-holding country,&mdash;a sort of shadowing forth of
the menace, more than once thrown out by Spain, to the
effect that if the colonists should ever attempt a revolution,
she would free and arm the blacks, and Cuba, made to
repeat the tragic tale of St. Domingo, should be useless to
the Creoles if lost to Spain. But we think Spain overestimates
the loyalty of the free people of color whom she
would now enroll beneath her banner. They cannot forget<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the days of O'Donnell (governor-general), when he avenged
the opposition of certain Cubans to the illicit and infamous
slave-trade by which he was enriching himself, by charging
them with an abolition conspiracy in conjunction with the
free blacks and mulattoes, and put many of the latter to
the torture to make them confess imaginary crimes; while
others, condemned without a trial, were mowed down by the
fire of platoons. Assuredly the people of color have no
reason for attachment to the <i>paternal</i> government of Spain.
And in this connection we may also remark that this
attempt at the enrolment of the blacks has already proved,
according to the admission of Spanish authority, a partial
failure, for they cannot readily learn the drill, and officers
dislike to take command of companies.</p>

<p>We have remarked that the Spanish troops are in a state
of rigid discipline, and exhibit much efficiency. They are to
the eye firm and serviceable troops,&mdash;the very best, doubtless,
that Spain can produce; but it must be remembered
that Spanish valor is but a feeble shadow of what it was in
the days of the Cid and the middle ages. A square of
Spanish infantry was once as impregnable as the Macedonian
phalanx; but they have sadly degenerated. The
actual value of the Spanish troops in Cuba may be estimated
by their behavior in the Lopez invasion. They
were then called upon, not to cope with a well-appointed
and equal force, but with an irregular, undisciplined band
of less than one-fourth their number, armed with wretched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
muskets, entirely ignorant of the simplest tactics, thrown
on a strange shore, and taken by surprise. Yet nearly a
full regiment of infantry, perfectly drilled and equipped,
flank companies, commanded by a general who was styled
the Napoleon of Cuba, were driven from the field by a few
irregular volleys from their opponents. And when again
the same commanding officer brought a yet greater force of
every arm,&mdash;cavalry, rifles, infantry and artillery,&mdash;against
the same body of insurgents, fatigued and reduced in numbers
and arms, they were again disgracefully routed. What
dependence can be placed upon such troops? They are
only capable of overawing an unarmed population.</p>

<p>The Cubans seem to fear very little from the power or
efforts of the Spanish troops in connection with the idea of
any well-organized revolutionary attempt, and even count
(as they have good reason to do) upon their abandoning the
Spanish flag the moment there is a doubt of its success.
They say that the troops are enlisted in Spain either by
glowing pictures of the luxury and ease of a military life
in Cuba, or to escape the severity of justice for the commission
of some crime. They no sooner arrive in the island
than the deception of the recruiting sergeants becomes
glaringly apparent. They see themselves isolated completely
from the people, treated with the utmost cruelty in
the course of their drills, and oppressed by the weight of
regulations that reduce them to the condition of machines,
without any enjoyments to alleviate the wretchedness of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
their situation. Men thus treated are not to be relied upon
in time of emergency; they can <i>think</i>, if they are not permitted
to act, and will have opinions of their own.</p>

<p>Soldiers thus ruled naturally come to hate those in
authority over them, finding no redress for their wrongs,
and no sympathy for their troubles. Their immediate officers
and those higher in station are equally inaccessible to
them, and deaf to their complaints; and when, in the hour
of danger, they are called upon to sustain the government
which so cruelly oppresses them, and proclamations, abounding
in Spanish hyperbole, speak of the honor and glory of
the Spanish army and its attachment to the crown, they
know perfectly well that these declarations and flatteries
proceed from the lips of men who entertain no such sentiments
in their hearts, and who only come to Cuba to
oppress a people belonging to the same Spanish family as
themselves. Thus the despotic system of the Spanish officers,
combined with the complete isolation of the troops
from the Creole population, has an effect directly contrary
to that contemplated, and only creates a readiness on the
part of the troops to sympathize with the people they are
brought to oppress. The constant presence of a large military
force increases the discontent and indignation of the
Creoles. They know perfectly well its object, and regard
it as a perpetual insult, a bitter, ironical commentary on the
epithet of "ever faithful" with which the home government
always addresses its western vassal. The loyalty of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
Cuba is indeed a royal fiction. As well might a highwayman
praise the generosity of a rich traveller who surrenders
his purse, watch and diamonds, at the muzzle of the
pistol. Cuban loyalty is evinced in an annual tribute of
some twenty-four millions of hard money; the freedom of
the gift is proved by the perpetual presence of twenty-five
to thirty thousand men, armed to the teeth!<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The complete military force of Cuba must embrace at the
present time very nearly thirty thousand troops,&mdash;artillery,
dragoons and infantry,&mdash;nearly twenty thousand of which
force is in and about Havana. To keep such a body of
soldiers in order, when governed by the principles we have
described, the utmost rigor is necessary, and military executions
are very frequent. The <i>garrote</i> is the principal
instrument of capital punishment used in the island,&mdash;a
machine contrived to choke the victim to death without
suspending him in the air. The criminal is placed in a
chair, leaning his head back upon a support prepared for it,
when a neck-yoke or collar of iron is drawn up close to the
throat. At the appointed moment, a screw is turned behind,
producing instantaneous death, the spinal cord being crushed
where it unites with the brain. This, though a repulsive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
idea, is far more merciful than hanging, it would seem,
whereby life is destroyed by the lingering process of suffocation.
The most common mode of execution, however,
in the army, is the legitimate death of a soldier; and, when
he is condemned, he always falls by the hands of his comrades.</p>

<p>The writer witnessed one of these military executions in
the rear of the barracks that make the seaward side of the
<i>Plaza de Armas</i>, one fine summer's morning. It was a
fearful sight, and one that chilled the blood even in a tropical
summer day! A Spanish soldier of the line was to be shot
for some act of insubordination against the stringent army
rules and regulations; and, in order that the punishment
might have a salutary effect upon his regiment, the whole
were drawn up to witness the scene. The immediate file of
twelve men to which the prisoner had belonged when in the
ranks, were supplied with muskets by their officer, and I
was told that <i>one</i> musket was left without <i>ball</i>, so that each
one might hope that his was not the hand to slay his former
comrade, and yet a sense of mercy would cause them all to
aim at the heart. The order was given; the bright morning
sun shone like living fire along the polished barrels of
the guns, as the fatal muzzles all ranged in point at the
heart of the condemned. "<i>Fuego!</i>" (fire) said the commanding
officer. A report followed, accompanied by a
cloud of smoke, which the sea breeze soon dispersed, showing
us the still upright form of the victim. Though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
wounded in many places, no vital part was touched, nor did
he fall until his sergeant, advancing quickly, with a single
reserved shot blew his brains over the surrounding green-sward!
His body was immediately removed, the troops
were formed into companies, the band struck up a lively
air, and thus was a human being launched into eternity.</p>

<p>A very common sight in the cities or large towns of Cuba
early in the morning, is to meet a Montero from the country,
riding his donkey, to the tail of which another donkey is
tied, and to this second one's tail a third, and so on, up to
a dozen, or less. These animals are loaded with large panniers,
filled with various articles of produce; some bearing
cornstalks for food for city animals; some hay, or straw;
others oranges, or bananas, or cocoanuts, etc.; some with
<i>bunches</i> of live fowls hanging by the feet over the donkey's
back. The people live, to use a common phrase, "from
hand to mouth,"&mdash;that is, they lay in no stores whatever,
and trust to the coming day to supply its own necessities.
Hay, cornstalks, or grain, are purchased only in sufficient
quantity for the day's consumption. So with meats, so
with fruits, so with everything. When it is necessary to
send to the market, the steward or stewardess of the house,
always a negro man or woman, is freely entrusted with the
required sum, and purchases according to his or her judgment
and taste. The cash system is universally adopted,
and all articles are regularly paid for when purchased.
The Monteros, who thus bring their produce to market,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
wear broad palm-leaf hats, and striped shirts over brown
pantaloons, with a sword by their side, and heavy spurs
upon their heels. Their load once disposed of, with a strong
cigar lighted in their mouths, they trot back to the country
again to pile up the panniers, and on the morrow once more
to supply the wants of the town. They are an industrious
and manly race of yeomanry.</p>

<p>Few matters strike the observant stranger with a stronger
sense of their peculiarity than the Cuban milk-man's mode
of supplying that necessary aliment to his town or city customers.
He has no cart filled with shining cans, and they
in turn filled with milk (or what purports to be milk, but
which is apt strongly to savor of Cochituate or Croton),
so there can be no deception as to the genuine character of
the article which he supplies. Driving his sober kine from
door to door, he deliberately milks just the quantity required
by each customer, delivers it, and drives on to the next.
The patient animal becomes as conversant with the residence
of her master's customers as he is himself, and stops unbidden
at regular intervals before the proper houses, often followed
by a pretty little calf which amuses itself by gazing at
the process, while it wears a leather muzzle to prevent its
interference with the supply of milk intended for another
quarter. There are doubtless two good reasons for this
mode of delivering milk in Havana and the large towns of
Cuba. First, there can be no diluting of the article, and
second, it is sure to be sweet and fresh, this latter a parti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>cular
desideratum in a climate where milk without ice can
be kept only a brief period without spoiling. Of course,
the effect upon the animal is by no means salutary, and a
Cuban cow gives but about one third as much milk as our
own. Goats are driven about and milked in the same manner.</p>

<p>Glass windows are scarcely known even in the cities. The
finest as well as the humblest town houses have the broad
projecting window, secured only by heavy iron bars (most
prison-like in aspect), through which, as one passes along
the narrow streets, it is nearly impossible to avoid glancing
upon domestic scenes that exhibit the female portion of the
family engaged in sewing, chatting, or some simple occupation.
Sometimes a curtain intervenes, but even this is unusual,
the freest circulation of air being always courted in
every way.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Once inside of the dwelling houses there are
few doors, curtains alone, shutting off the communication
between chambers and private rooms, and from the corridor
upon which they invariably open. Of course, the curtain
when down is quite sufficient to keep out persons of the
household or strangers, but the little naked negro slave
children (always petted at this age), male and female, creep
under this <i>ad libitum</i>, and the monkeys, parrots, pigeons,
and fowls generally make common store of every nook and
corner. Doors might keep these out of your room, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
curtains do not. One reason why the Cubans, of both sexes,
possess such fine expansive chests, is doubtless the fact that
their lungs thus find full and unrestrained action, living, as
it were, ever in the open air. The effect of this upon the
stranger is at once visible in a sense of physical exhilaration,
fine spirits and good appetite. It would be scarcely
possible to inhabit a house built after our close, secure style,
if it were placed in the city of Havana, or even on an inland
plantation of the island. The town houses are always
accessible upon the roofs, where during the day the laundress
takes possession, but at evening they are frequently
the family resort, where the evening cigar is enjoyed, and
the gossip of the day discussed, in the enjoyment of the sea
breeze that sweeps in from the waters of the Gulf of
Mexico.</p>

<p>Just outside the city walls of Havana, and on the immediate
sea-coast, lies the Campo Santo, or public cemetery,
not far from the city prison. It is approached by a long
street of dilapidated and miserable dwellings, and is not attractive
to the eye, though the immediate entrance is through
cultivated shrubbery. A broad, thick wall encloses the
cemetery, in which oven-like niches are prepared for the
reception of the coffins, containing the better or more
wealthy classes, while the poor are thrown into shallow
graves, sometimes several together, not unfrequently
negroes and whites, without a coffin, quicklime being freely
used to promote decomposition. In short, the whole idea,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
and every association of the Campo Santo, is of a repulsive
and disagreeable character.</p>

<p>This irreverent treatment of the dead, and the neglected
condition of their place of sepulture, is a sad feature in a
Christian country, contrasting strongly with the honors paid
to the memory of the departed by semi-civilized and even
savage nations. We all know the sacredness that is attached
by the Turks to their burial grounds, how the mournful
cypresses are taught to rise among the turbaned tombstones,
and how the survivors are wont to sit upon the graves
of the departed, musing for hours over the loved and lost,
and seeming to hold communion with their liberated spirits.
How different is it here with the Campo Santo! The bitterest
pang that an Indian endures when compelled to leave
his native hunting grounds, is that he must abandon the
place where the ashes of his ancestors repose. The enlightened
spirit which removes cemeteries from the centre of
dense population is worthy of all commendation&mdash;the taste
that adorns them with trees and flowers, beautifying the
spot where the "last of earth" reposes, is a proof of high-toned
feeling and a high civilization. Nothing of this spirit
is manifested at Havana. The establishment of the cemetery
without the walls of the city was a sanitary measure,
dictated by obvious necessity, but there the march of improvement
stopped. No effort has been made to follow
the laudable example of other countries; no, the Spanish
character, arrogant and self-sufficient, will not bend to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
taught by others, and will not admit a possibility of error,
and they are as closely wedded to national prejudices as the
Chinese. Spain is, at this moment, the most old-fashioned
country of Christendom, and it is only when pressed upon by
absolute necessity that she reluctantly admits of innovation.</p>

<p>Tacon, during his rule in the island, erected outside the
city walls, and near the gate of La Punta, on the shore, a
spacious prison, capable of accommodating five thousand
prisoners. It is quadrangular, each side being some three
hundred feet long and fifty high, enclosing a central square,
planted with shrubbery and watered by a cooling and graceful
fountain. The fresh breeze circulates freely through its
walls, and it is considered one of the healthiest spots in the
vicinity of the capital, while it certainly presents a strong
contrast to the neglected precincts of the Campo Santo,
hard by.</p>

<p>The fish-market of Havana affords probably the best
variety of this article of any city in the world. The long
marble counters display the most novel and tempting array
that one can well imagine; every hue of the rainbow is represented,
and a great variety of shapes. But a curse
hangs over this species of food, plenty and fine as it is, for
it is made a government monopoly, and none but its agents
are permitted to sell or to catch it in the vicinity of the city.
This singular law, established under Tacon, is of peculiar
origin, and we cannot perhaps do better than tell the story,
as gathered on the spot, for the amusement of the reader.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE STORY OF MARTI, THE SMUGGLER.</h4>


<p>One of the most successful villains whose story will be
written in history, is a man named Marti, as well known in
Cuba as the person of the governor-general himself. Formerly
he was notorious as a smuggler and half pirate on the
coast of the island, being a daring and accomplished leader
of reckless men. At one time he bore the title of King of
the Isle of Pines, where was his principal rendezvous, and
from whence he despatched his vessels, small, fleet crafts,
to operate in the neighboring waters.</p>

<p>His story, well known in Cuba and to the home government,
bears intimately upon our subject.</p>

<p>When Tacon landed on the island, and became governor-general,
he found the revenue laws in a sad condition, as
well as the internal regulations of the island; and, with a
spirit of mingled justice and oppression, he determined to
do something in the way of reform.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The Spanish marine
sent out to regulate the maritime matters of the island, lay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
idly in port, the officers passing their time on shore, or in
giving balls and dances on the decks of their vessels.
Tacon saw that one of the first moves for him to make was
to suppress the smuggling upon the coast, at all hazards;
and to this end he set himself directly to work. The maritime
force at his command was at once detailed upon this
service, and they coasted night and day, but without the
least success against the smugglers. In vain were all the
vigilance and activity of Tacon and his agents&mdash;they
accomplished nothing.</p>

<p>At last, finding that all his expeditions against them
failed, partly from the adroitness and bravery of the smugglers,
and partly from the want of pilots among the shoals
and rocks that they frequented, a large and tempting
reward was offered to any one of them who would desert
from his comrades and act in this capacity in behalf of the
government. At the same time, a double sum, most
princely in amount, was offered for the person of one Marti,
dead or alive, who was known to be the leader of the lawless
rovers who thus defied the government. These rewards
were freely promulgated, and posted so as to reach the ears
and eyes of those whom they concerned; but even these
seemed to produce no effect, and the government officers
were at a loss how to proceed in the matter.</p>

<p>It was a dark, cloudy night in Havana, some three or
four months subsequent to the issuing of these placards
announcing the rewards as referred to, when two sentinels<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
were pacing backwards and forwards before the main
entrance to the governor's palace, just opposite the grand
plaza. A little before midnight, a man, wrapped in a cloak,
was watching them from behind the statue of Ferdinand,
near the fountain, and, after observing that the two soldiers
acting as sentinels paced their brief walk so as to meet
each other, and then turn their backs as they separated,
leaving a brief moment in the interval when the eyes of
both were turned away from the entrance they were placed
to guard, seemed to calculate upon passing them unobserved.
It was an exceedingly delicate man&oelig;uvre and
required great care and dexterity to effect it; but, at last,
it was adroitly done, and the stranger sprang lightly
through the entrance, secreting himself behind one of the
pillars in the inner court of the palace. The sentinels paced
on undisturbed.</p>

<p>The figure which had thus stealthily effected an entrance,
now sought the broad stairs that led to the governor's suit
of apartments, with a confidence that evinced a perfect
knowledge of the place. A second guard-post was to be
passed at the head of the stairs; but, assuming an air of
authority, the stranger offered a cold military salute and
pressed forward, as though there was not the most distant
question of his right so to do; and thus avoiding all suspicion
in the guard's mind, he boldly entered the governor's
reception room unchallenged, and closed the door
behind him. In a large easy chair sat the commander-in-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>chief,
busily engaged in writing, but alone. An expression
of undisguised satisfaction passed across the weather-beaten
countenance of the new comer at this state of affairs, as he
coolly cast off his cloak and tossed it over his arm, and then
proceeded to wipe the perspiration from his face. The governor,
looking up with surprise, fixed his keen eyes upon
the intruder,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who enters here, unannounced, at this hour?" he
asked, sternly, while he regarded the stranger earnestly.</p>

<p>"One who has information of value for the governor-general.
You are Tacon, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I am. What would you with me? or, rather, how
did you pass my guard unchallenged?"</p>

<p>"Of that anon. Excellency, you have offered a handsome
reward for information concerning the rovers of the
gulf?"</p>

<p>"Ha! yes. What of them?" said Tacon, with undisguised
interest.</p>

<p>"Excellency, I must speak with caution," continued
the new comer; "otherwise I may condemn and sacrifice
myself."</p>

<p>"You have naught to fear on that head. The offer of
reward for evidence against the scapegraces also vouchsafes
a pardon to the informant. You may speak on, without
fear for yourself, even though you may be one of the very
confederation itself."</p>

<p>"You offer a reward, also, in addition, for the discovery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
of Marti,&mdash;Captain Marti, of the smugglers,&mdash;do you
not?"</p>

<p>"We do, and will gladly make good the promise of
reward for any and all information upon the subject,"
replied Tacon.</p>

<p>"First, Excellency, do you give me your knightly word
that you will grant a free pardon to <i>me</i>, if I reveal all that
you require to know, even embracing the most secret
hiding-places of the rovers?"</p>

<p>"I pledge you my word of honor," said the commander.</p>

<p>"No matter how heinous in the sight of the law my
offences may have been, still you will pardon me, under the
king's seal?"</p>

<p>"I will, if you reveal truly and to any good purpose,"
answered Tacon, weighing in his mind the purpose of all
this precaution.</p>

<p>"Even if I were a leader among the rovers, myself?"</p>

<p>The governor hesitated for a moment, canvassing in a
single glance the subject before him, and then said:</p>

<p>"Even then, be you whom you may; if you are able
and will honestly pilot our ships and reveal the secrets of
Marti and his followers, you shall be rewarded as our proffer
sets forth, and yourself receive a free pardon."</p>

<p>"Excellency, I think I know your character well enough
to trust you, else I should not have ventured here."</p>

<p>"Speak, then; my time is precious," was the impatient
reply of Tacon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, Excellency, the man for whom you have offered
the largest reward, dead or alive, is now before you!"</p>

<p>"And you are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Marti!"</p>

<p>The governor-general drew back in astonishment, and
cast his eyes towards a brace of pistols that lay within
reach of his right hand; but it was only for a single moment,
when he again assumed entire self-control, and said,
"I shall keep my promise, sir, provided you are faithful,
though the laws call loudly for your punishment, and even
now you are in my power. To insure your faithfulness,
you must remain at present under guard." Saying which,
he rang a silver bell by his side, and issued a verbal order
to the attendant who answered it. Immediately after, the
officer of the watch entered, and Marti was placed in confinement,
with orders to render him comfortable until he
was sent for. His name remained a secret with the commander;
and thus the night scene closed.</p>

<p>On the following day, one of the men-of-war that lay
idly beneath the guns of Moro Castle suddenly became the
scene of the utmost activity, and, before noon, had weighed
her anchor, and was standing out into the gulf stream.
Marti, the smuggler, was on board, as her pilot; and faithfully
did he guide the ship, on the discharge of his treacherous
business, among the shoals and bays of the coast for
nearly a month, revealing every secret haunt of the rovers,
exposing their most valuable depots and well-selected ren<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>dezvous;
and many a smuggling craft was taken and
destroyed. The amount of money and property thus secured
was very great; and Marti returned with the ship to
claim his reward from the governor-general, who, well satisfied
with the manner in which the rascal had fulfilled his
agreement, and betrayed those comrades who were too faithful
to be tempted to treachery themselves, summoned Marti
before him.</p>

<p>"As you have faithfully performed your part of our
agreement," said the governor-general, "I am now prepared
to comply with the articles on my part. In this
package you will find a free and unconditional pardon for
all your past offences against the laws. And here is an
order on the treasury for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excellency, excuse me. The pardon I gladly receive.
As to the sum of money you propose to give to me, let me
make you a proposition. Retain the money; and, in place
of it, guarantee to me the right to fish in the neighborhood
of the city, and declare the trade in fish contraband to all
except my agents. This will richly repay me, and I will
erect a public market of stone at my own expense, which
shall be an ornament to the city, and which at the expiration
of a specified number of years shall revert to the government,
with all right and title to the fishery."</p>

<p>Tacon was pleased at the idea of a superb fish-market,
which should eventually revert to the government, and also
at the idea of saving the large sum of money covered by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
the promised reward. The singular proposition of the
smuggler was duly considered and acceded to, and Marti
was declared in legal form to possess for the future sole
right to fish in the neighborhood of the city, or to sell the
article in any form, and he at once assumed the rights that
the order guaranteed to him. Having in his roving life
learned all the best fishing-grounds, he furnished the city
bountifully with the article, and reaped yearly an immense
profit, until, at the close of the period for which the monopoly
was granted, he was the richest man on the island.
According to the agreement, the fine market and its privilege
reverted to the government at the time specified, and
the monopoly has ever since been rigorously enforced.</p>

<p>Marti, now possessed of immense wealth, looked about
him, to see in what way he could most profitably invest it
to insure a handsome and sure return. The idea struck
him if he could obtain the monopoly of theatricals in
Havana on some such conditions as he had done that of the
right to fish off its shores, he could still further increase his
ill-gotten wealth. He obtained the monopoly, on condition
that he should erect one of the largest and finest theatres in
the world, which he did, as herein described, locating the
same just outside the city walls. With the conditions of
the monopoly, the writer is not conversant.</p>

<p>Many romantic stories are told of Marti; but the one we
have here related is the only one that is authenticated, and
which has any bearing upon the present work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a monthly lottery in Havana, with prizes
amounting to one hundred and ten thousand dollars, and
sometimes as high as one hundred and eighty thousand dollars,
under the immediate direction and control of the
authorities, and which is freely patronized by the first mercantile
houses, who have their names registered for a certain
number of tickets each month. The poorer classes,
too, by clubbing together, become purchasers of tickets,
including slaves and free negroes; and it is but a few years
since, that some slaves, who had thus united and purchased
a ticket, drew the first prize of sixty thousand dollars;
which was honestly paid to them, and themselves liberated
by the purchase of their freedom from their masters. Honestly
and strictly conducted as these lotteries are, yet their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
very stability, and the just payment of all prizes, but makes
them the more baneful and dangerous in their influence
upon the populace. Though now and then a poor man
becomes rich through their means, yet thousands are impoverished
in their mad zeal to purchase tickets, though it cost
them their last medio. The government thus countenances
and fosters a taste for gambling, while any one acquainted
at all with the Spanish character, must know that the people
need no prompting in a vice to which they seem to take
intuitively.</p>

<p>The Spaniards receive credit for being a very hospitable
people, and to a certain extent this is due to them; but the
stranger soon learns to regard the extravagant manifestations
which too often characterize their etiquette, as quite
empty and heartless. Let a stranger enter the house of a
Cuban for the first time, and the host or hostess of the
mansion says at once, either in such words or their equivalent,
"All that we have is at your service; take what you
will, and our right hand with it." Yet no one thinks of
understanding this literally. The family volante is at your
order, or a saddle horse; and in such small kindnesses they
are indeed polite; but when they beg of you to accept a
ring, a book, a valuable toy, because you have happened to
praise it, you are by no means to do so. Another trait of
character which suggests itself in this connection, is their
Universal habit of profuse compliment.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The ladies listen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
to them, as a matter of course, from their countrymen, or
from such Frenchmen as have become domesticated in the
island; but if an American takes occasion to compliment
them, they are at once delighted, for they believe them to
be sincere, and the matter is secretly treasured to be
repeated.</p>

<p>The Cuban ladies, with true feminine acuteness, estimate
correctly the high-flown compliments of their countrymen;
and the kindred French, Castilian and Parisian politeness is
of about equal value, and means the same thing,&mdash;that is,
nothing. To strangers it is very pleasant at first, but the
moment it is apparent that these profuse protestations of
friendship and offers of service are transparent devices, and
that if you take them at their word they are embarrassed,
perhaps offended, that you must be constantly on your
guard, and be very careful to consider every fine phrase as
a flower of rhetoric, it becomes positively disagreeable.
Good manners go a great way; and if a person does you a
favor, the pleasure you experience is much enhanced by the
grace with which the obligation is conferred; but there is a
vast difference between true and false politeness. The
former springs only from a good and true heart; the latter
is especially egotistical. Both the French and Spanish are
extremely gallant to women; and yet the condition of
women in both France and Spain is vastly inferior to that
of our fair countrywomen, notwithstanding the Spanish
<i>caballero</i> and the Parisian <i>elegant</i> can couch their heart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>less
compliments in terms our plain people would vainly
attempt to imitate. But what cares a woman for fine
phrases, if she knows that the respect due to her sex is
wanting? The condition of the women of Cuba is eminently
Spanish, and she is here too often the slave of passion
and the victim of jealousy.</p>

<p>The bonnet, which forms so important a part of the
ladies' costume in Europe and American cities, is entirely
unknown, or, rather, never worn by the Creole ladies; and
strangers who appear with this article of dress are regarded
with as much curiosity as we should be exercised by to meet
in our own streets a Tuscarora chief in his war-paint. In
place of the bonnet the Cuban ladies wear a long black veil,
gathered at the back of the head upon the clustered braid
of hair (always dark and luxuriant), and drawn to one side
of the face or the other, as circumstances may require.
More frequently, however, even this appendage is not seen,
and they ride in the Paseos and streets with their heads
entirely uncovered, save by the sheltering hood of the
volante. When necessity calls them abroad during the
early or middle hours of the day, there is a canvas screen
buttoning to the dasher, and extending to the top of the
vehicle, forming a partial shelter from the sun. This apparatus
is universally arranged upon the volantes which stand
at the corners of the streets for common hire; but the private
vehicles are rarely seen much abroad before the early
twilight, or just before sunset.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>Full dress, on all state occasions, with the Cuban ladies,
is black; but white is worn on all ordinary ones, forming a
rich and striking contrast to the fair olive complexions of
the wearers. Jewelry is worn to a great extent, and, by
those who can afford it, to the amount of most fabulous
sums, of course the diamond predominating; but there is a
general fondness for opals, garnets and pearls, worn in
bracelets more particularly, or in bands about the hair, at
the top of the forehead. There is one article without which
the Cuban lady would not feel at home for a single moment;
it is the fan, which is a positive necessity to her, and
she learns its coquettish and graceful use from very childhood.
Formed of various rich materials, it glitters in her
hand like a gaudy butterfly, now half, now wholly shading
her radiant face, which quickly peeps out again from behind
its shelter, like the moon from out a gilded cloud. This
little article (always rich and expensive), perfectly indispensable
in a Cuban lady's costume, in their hands seems
almost to speak; she has a witching flirt with it that expresses
scorn; a graceful wave of complaisance; an abrupt
closing of it, that indicates vexation or anger; a gradual
and cautious opening of its folds, that signifies reluctant
forgiveness; in short, the language of the fan in a Cuban's
hand is an adroit and expressive pantomime, that requires
no foreign interpreter.</p>

<p>It may be owing to the prodigality of nature in respect
to Flora's kingdom, which has led to no development among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the people of Cuba, in the love and culture of flowers. Of
course this remark is intended in a general point of view,
there necessarily being exceptions to establish the rule.
But it is a rare thing to see flowers under cultivation here,
other than such as spring up from the over-fertile soil, unplanted
and untended. In New Orleans one cannot pass
out of the doors of the St. Charles Hotel, at any hour of
the day, without being saluted first by the flavor of magnolias,
and then by a Creole flower-girl, with "Buy a bouquet
for a dime, sir?" But nothing of the sort is seen in
Cuba; flowers are a drug. Nevertheless, I fear that people
who lack an appreciation of these "illumined scriptures of
the prairie," show a want of delicacy and refinement that
even an humble Parisian grisette is not without. Scarcely
can you pass from the coast of Cuba inland for half a
league, in any direction, without your senses being regaled
by the fragrance of natural flowers,&mdash;the heliotrope, honeysuckle,
sweet pea, and orange blossoms predominating.
The jessamine and cape rose, though less fragrant, are delightful
to the eye, and cluster everywhere, among the
hedges, groves and plantations.</p>

<p>There seems to be, at times, a strange narcotic influence
in the atmosphere of the island, more especially inland,
where the visitor is partially or wholly removed from the
winds that usually blow from the gulf in the after part of
the day. So potent has the writer felt this influence, that
at first it was supposed to be the effect of some powerful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
plant that might abound upon the plantations; but careful
inquiry satisfied him that this dreamy somnolence, this
delightful sense of ease and indolent luxuriance of feeling,
was solely attributable to the natural effect of the soft climate
of Cuba. By gently yielding to this influence, one
seems to dream while waking; and while the sense of hearing
is diminished, that of the olfactories appears to be increased,
and pleasurable odors float upon every passing
zephyr. One feels at peace with all human nature, and a
sense of voluptuous ease overspreads the body. Others
have spoken to the writer of this feeling of idle happiness,
which he has himself more than once experienced in the
delightful rural neighborhood of Alquizar. The only unpleasant
realizing sense during the enjoyment of the condition
referred to, is the fear that some human voice, or some
chance noise, loud and abrupt, shall arouse the waking
dreamer from a situation probably not unlike the pleasanter
effect of opium, without its unpleasant re&auml;ction.</p>

<p>As it regards the cost of living in the island, it may be
said to average rather high to the stranger, though it is
declared that the expense to those who permanently reside
here, either in town or country, is cheaper, all things considered,
than in the United States. At the city hotels and
best boarding-houses of Havana and Matanzas, the charge
is three dollars per day, unless a special bargain is made for
a considerable period of time. Inland, at the houses of
public entertainment, the charge per diem is, of course, con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>siderably
less; and the native style of living is nearly the
same within or out of the city. The luscious and healthful
fruits of the tropics form a large share of the provision for
the table, and always appear in great variety at dessert.
Good common claret wine is regularly placed before the
guest without charge, it being the ordinary drink of the
people. As to the mode of cooking, it seems to be very
like the French, though the universal garlic, which appears
to be a positive necessity to a Spanish palate, is very apt to
form a disagreeable preponderance in the flavor of every
dish. Fish, meat and fowl are so disguised with this article
and with spices, that one is fain to resort to the bill of
fare, to ascertain of what he is partaking. The vegetable
soups of the city houses (but for the garlic) are excellent,
many of the native vegetables possessing not only admirable
flavor, and other desirable properties for the purpose, but
being also glutinous, add much to the properties of a preparation
answering to the character of our Julian soup.
Oysters, though plentiful on the coast, are of inferior quality,
and are seldom used for the table; but pickled oysters
from the United States are largely used in the cities.</p>

<p>One of the pleasantest places of resort for enjoyment on
the whole island, is probably the town of Guines, connected
with Havana by a railroad (the first built upon the soil of
Cuba), and but a few leagues from the capital.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
locality is thought to be one of the most salubrious and appropriate
for invalids, and has therefore become a general
resort for this class, possessing several good public houses,
and in many respects is quite Americanized with regard to
comforts and the necessities of visitors from the United
States. In Guines, and indeed in all Cuban towns, villages,
and even small hamlets, there is a spacious cock-pit,
where the inhabitants indulge in the sport of cock-fighting,&mdash;an
absorbing passion with the humble, and oftentimes
with the better classes. This indulgence is illustrative of
their nature,&mdash;that is, the Spanish nature and blood that is
in them,&mdash;a fact that is equally attested by their participation
in the fearful contest of the bull-fight. It is really
astonishing how fierce these birds become by training; and
they always fight until one or the other dies, unless they
are interfered with. The amount of money lost and won by
this cruel mode of gambling is very large daily. Ladies
frequently attend these exhibitions, the upper seats being
reserved for them; and they may, not unfrequently, be
seen entering fully into the excitement of the sport.</p>

<p>The cock-pit is a large or small circular building, not
unlike, in external appearance, to a New England out-door
hay-stack, its dimensions being governed by the populousness
of the locality where it is erected. The seats are
raised in a circle, around a common centre, where the birds
are fought, or "pitted," upon prepared ground, covered
with saw-dust or tan. The cocks, which are of a peculiar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
species of game birds, are subjected from chickenhood, so to
speak, to a peculiar course of treatment. Their food is regularly
weighed, and so many ounces of grain are laid out for
each day's consumption, so that the bird is never permitted
to grow fat, but is kept in "condition" at all times. The
feathers are kept closely cropped in a jaunty style, and
neck and head, to the length of three inches or more, are
completely plucked of all feathers, and daily rubbed with
<i>aguadiente</i> (island rum), until they become so calloused
that they are insensible to any ordinary wound which its
antagonist might inflict. Brief encounters are encouraged
among them while they are young, under proper restrictions,
and no fear is had of their injuring themselves, until
they are old enough to have the <i>steel gaffs</i> affixed upon
those which nature has given them. Then, like armed
men, with swords and daggers, they attack each other, and
the blood will flow at every stroke, the conflict being in no
degree impeded, nor the birds affrighted, by the noisy cries,
jeers, and loud challenges of the excited horde of gamblers
who throng all sides of the cock-pit.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Cuba has been justly styled the garden of the world, perpetual
summer smiling upon its favored shores, and its natural
wealth almost baffling the capacity of estimation. The
waters which surround it, as we have already intimated,
abound with a variety of fishes, whose bright colors, emu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>lating
the tints of precious stones and the prismatic hues
of the rainbow, astonish the eye of the stranger. Stately
trees of various species, the most conspicuous being the
royal palm, rear their luxuriant foliage against the azure
heavens, along the sheltered bays, by the way-side, on the
swells of the haciendas, delighting the eye of the traveller,
and diversifying the ever-charming face of the tropical
landscape. Through the woods and groves flit a variety of
birds, whose dazzling colors defy the palette of the artist.
Here the loquacious parrot utters his harsh natural note;
there the red flamingo stands patiently by the shore of the
lagoon, watching in the waters, dyed by the reflection of his
plumage, for his unconscious prey. It would require a
volume to describe the vegetable, animal and mineral kingdom
of Cuba. Among the most familiar birds, and those
the names of which even the casual observer is apt to learn,
are the Cuba robin, the blue-bird, the cat-bird, the Spanish
woodpecker, the gaudy-plumed parrot, the pedoreva, with
its red throat and breast and its pea-green head and body.
There is also a great variety of wild pigeons, blue, gray
and white; the English ladybird, as it is called, with a
blue head and scarlet breast, and green and white back;
the indigo-bird, the golden-winged woodpecker, the ibis, the
flamingo, and many smaller species, like the humming-bird.
Parrots settle on the sour orange trees when the fruit is

Creoles stew and eat them as we do the pigeon; the flesh is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
rather tough, and as there are plenty of fine water and
marsh birds about the lagoons, which are most tender and
palatable, one is at a loss to account for the taste that leads
the people to eat the parrot. The brown pelican is very
plenty on the sea-coast, like the gull off our own shores,
and may be seen at all times sailing lazily over the sea, and
occasionally dipping for fish. Here, as among other tropical
regions, and even in some southern sections of this
country, the lazy-looking bald-headed vulture is protected
by law, being a sort of natural scavenger or remover of
carrion.</p>

<p>The agriculturists of the island confine their attention
almost solely to the raising of sugar, coffee and tobacco,
almost entirely neglecting Indian corn (which the first settlers
found indigenous here), and but slightly attending to
the varieties of the orange.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> It is scarcely creditable that,
when the generous soil produces from two to three crops
annually, the vegetable wealth of this island should be so
poorly developed. It is capable of supporting a population
of almost any density, and yet the largest estimate gives
only a million and a half of inhabitants. On treading the
fertile soil, and on beholding the clustering fruits offered on
all sides, the delicious oranges, the perfumed pine-apples,
the luscious bananas, the cooling cocoanuts, and other fruits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
for which our language has no name, we are struck with the
thought of how much Providence, and how little man, has
done for this Eden of the Gulf. We long to see it peopled
by men who can appreciate the gifts of nature, men who are
willing to do their part in reward for her bounty, men who
will meet her half way and second her spontaneous efforts.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
Nowhere on the face of the globe would intelligent labor
meet with a richer reward,&mdash;nowhere on the face of the
globe would repose from labor be so sweet. The hour of
rest here sinks upon the face of nature with a peculiar
charm; the night breeze comes with its gentle wing to fan
the weary frame, and no danger lurks in its career. It has
free scope through the unglazed windows. Beautifully blue
are the heavens, and festally bright the stars of a tropical
night. Pre&euml;minent in brilliancy among the constellations
is the Southern Cross, a galaxy of stars that never greets
us in the north. At midnight its glittering framework
stands erect; that solemn hour passed, the Cross declines.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
How glorious the night where such a heavenly sentinel indicates
its watches! Cuba is indeed a land of enchantment,
where nature is beautiful, and where mere existence is a
luxury, but it requires the infusion of a sterner, more self-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>denying
and enterprising race to fully test its capabilities,
and to astonish the world with its productiveness.</p>

<p>We have thus dilated upon the natural resources of Cuba,
and depicted the charms that rest about her; but every picture
has its dark side, and the political situation of the island
is the reverse in the present instance. Her wrongs are multifarious,
and the restrictions placed upon her by her oppressors
are each and all of so heinous and tyrannical a
character, that a chapter upon each would be insufficient
to place them in their true light before the world. There
is, however, no better way of placing the grievances of the
Cubans, as emanating from the home government, clearly
before the reader, than by stating such of them as occur
readily to the writer's mind in brief:&mdash;</p>

<p>She is permitted no voice in the Cortes; the press is under
the vilest censorship; farmers are compelled to pay ten
per cent. on all their harvest except sugar, and on that article
two and a half per cent.; the island has been under
martial law since 1825; over $23,000,000 of taxes are
levied upon the inhabitants, to be squandered by Spain; ice
is monopolized by the government; flour is so taxed as to
be inadmissible; a Creole must purchase a license before he
can invite a few friends to take a cup of tea at his board;
there is a stamped paper, made legally necessary for special
purposes of contract, costing eight dollars per sheet; no
goods, either in or out of doors, can be sold without a license;
the natives of the island are excluded entirely from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
army, the judiciary, the treasury, and the customs; the
military government assumes the charge of the schools;
the grazing of cattle is taxed exorbitantly; newspapers
from abroad, with few exceptions, are contraband; letters
passing through the post are opened and purged of their
contents before delivery; fishing on the coast is forbidden,
being a government monopoly; planters are forbidden to
send their sons to the United States for educational purposes;
the slave-trade is secretly encouraged by government;
no person can remove from one house to another
without first paying for a government permit; all cattle (the
same as goods) that are sold must pay six per cent. of their
value to government; in short, every possible subterfuge is
resorted to by the government officials to swindle the people,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
everything being taxed, and there is no appeal from
the decision of the captain-general!</p>

<p>The volante, that one vehicle of Cuba, has been several
times referred to in the foregoing pages. It is difficult without
experience to form an idea of its extraordinary ease of
motion or its appropriateness to the peculiarities of the
country.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> It makes nothing of the deep mud that accompanies
the rainy season, but, with its enormous wheels, six
feet in diameter, heavy shafts, and low-hung, chaise-like
body, it dashes over and through every impediment with the
utmost facility. Strange as it may seem, it is very light
upon the horse, which is also bestridden by the postilion, or
<i>calisero</i>. When travelling any distance upon the road, a
second horse is added on the left, abreast, and attached to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the volante by an added whiffletree and traces. When there
are two horses in this style, the postilion rides the one to
the left, leaving the shaft horse free of other weight than
that of the vehicle.</p>

<p>When the roads are particularly bad and there is more
than usual weight to carry, of baggage, etc., a third horse
is often used, but he is still placed abreast with the others,
to the right of the shaft horse, and guided by a bridle rein
in the hands of the calisero. The Spaniards take great
pride in these volantes, especially those improved for city
use, and they are often to be met with elaborately mounted
with silver, and in many instances with gold, wrought with
great skill and beauty. There were volantes pointed out to
the writer, of this latter character, in Havana, that could
not have cost less than two thousand dollars each, and this
for a two-wheeled vehicle. A volante equipped in this
style, with the gaily dressed calisero, his scarlet jacket elaborately
trimmed with silver braid, his high jack-boots with
silver buckles at the knee, and monstrous spurs upon his
heels, with rowels an inch long, makes quite a dashing appearance,
especially if a couple of blackeyed Creole ladies
happen to constitute the freight. Thus they direct their
way to the Tacon Paseo, to meet the fashion of the town at
the close of the day&mdash;almost the only out-door recreation
for the sex.</p>

<p>Of all the games and sports of the Cubans, that of the
bull-fight is the most cruel and fearful, and without one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
redeeming feature in its indulgence. The arena for the
exhibitions in the neighborhood of Havana is just across the
harbor at Regla, a small town, having a most worn and
dilapidated appearance.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> This place was formerly the haunt
of pirates, upon whose depredations and boldness the government,
for reasons best known to itself, shut its official
eyes; more latterly it has been the hailing place for slavers,
whose crafts have not yet entirely disappeared, though the
rigor of the English and French cruisers in the Gulf has rendered
it necessary for them to seek a less exposed rendezvous.
Of the Spanish marine they entertain no fear; there
is the most perfect understanding on this point, treaty stipulations
touching the slave-trade, between Spain, England
and France, to the contrary notwithstanding.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> But we
were referring to the subject of the bull-fights. The arena
at Regla, for this purpose, is a large circular enclosure of
sufficient dimensions to seat six thousand people, and affording
perhaps a little more than half an acre of ground for
the fight.</p>

<p>The seats are raised one above another in a circle around,
at a secure height from the dangerous struggle which is
sure to characterize each exhibition. On the occasion when
the writer was present, after a flourish of trumpets, a large
bull was let loose from a stall opening into the pit of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
enclosure, where three Spaniards (<i>toreadors</i>), one on
foot and two on horseback, were ready to receive him, the
former armed with a sword, the latter with spears. They
were three hardened villains, if the human countenance can
be relied upon as shadowing forth the inner man, seemingly
reckless to the last degree, but very expert, agile, and wary.
These men commenced at once to worry and torment the
bull until they should arouse him to a state of frenzy. Short
spears were thrust into his neck and sides with rockets
attached, which exploded into his very flesh, burning and
affrighting the poor creature. Thrusts from the horsemen's
spears were made into his flesh, and while he was bleeding
thus at every pore, gaudy colors were shaken before his
glowing eyes; and wherever he turned to escape his tormentors,
he was sure to be met with some freshly devised
expedient of torment, until at last the creature became
indeed perfectly infuriated and frantically mad. Now the
fight was in earnest!</p>

<p>In vain did the bull plunge gallantly and desperately at
his enemies, they were far too expert for him. They had
made this game their business perhaps for years. Each rush
he made upon them was easily avoided, and he passed them
by, until, in his headlong course, he thrust his horns deep
into the boards of the enclosure. The idea, of course, was
not to give him any fatal wounds at the outset, and thus
dispatch him at once, but to worry and torment him to the
last. One of the gladiators now attacked him closely with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
the sword, and dexterously wounded him in the back of the
neck at each plunge the animal made towards him, at the
same time springing on one side to avoid the shock. After
a long fight and at a grand flourish of trumpets, the most
skilful of the swordsmen stood firm and received the infuriated
beast on the point of his weapon, which was aimed at
a fatal spot above the frontlet, leading direct to the brain.
The effect was electrical, and like dropping the curtain upon
a play: the animal staggered, reeled a moment, and fell
dead! Three bulls were thus destroyed, the last one in his
frenzy goring a fine spirited horse, on which one of the gladiators
was mounted, to death, and trampling his rider fearfully.
During the exhibition, the parties in the arena were
encouraged to feats of daring by the waving of handkerchiefs
and scarfs in the hands of the fair se&ntilde;oras and se&ntilde;oritas.
Indeed there is generally a young girl trained to the
business, who takes a part in the arena with the matadors
against the bull. The one thus engaged, on the occasion
here referred to, could not have exceeded seventeen years
in age.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Whatever colonial modifications the Spanish character
may have undergone in Cuba, the Creole is Castilian still
in his love for the cruel sports of the arena, and there is a
great similarity between the modern Spaniards and the an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>cient
Romans in this respect. As the Spanish language
more closely resembles Latin than Italian, so do the Spanish
people show more of Roman blood than the natives of
Italy themselves. <i>Panem et circenses</i> (bread and circuses!)
was the cry of the old Roman populace, and to
gratify their wishes millions of sesterces were lavished, and,
hecatombs of human victims slain, in the splendid amphitheatres
erected by the masters of the world in all the cities
subjected to their sway. And so <i>pan y toros</i> (bread and
bulls!) is the imperious demand of the Spaniards, to which
the government always promptly responds.</p>

<p>The parallel may be pursued still further: the loveliest
ladies of Rome gazed with rapture upon the dying agonies
of the gladiators who hewed each other in pieces, or the
Christian's who perished in conflict with the wild beasts half
starved to give them battle! The beauteous se&ntilde;oras and
se&ntilde;oritas of Madrid and Havana enjoy with a keen delight
the terrible spectacle of bulls speared by the <i>picador</i>,
or gallant horses ripped up and disembowelled by the
horns of their brute adversaries. It is true that the ameliorating
spirit of Christianity is evident in the changes
which the arena has undergone; human lives are not sacrificed
wholesale in the combats; and yet the bull-fight
is sufficiently barbarous and atrocious. It is a national
institution, and, as an indication of national character, is
well worthy of attention, however repulsive to the sensitive
mind. The queen of England is sometimes pres<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>ent
on the race-track, so also the queen of Spain occupies
the royal box at the great bull-festas of Madrid. A skilful
bull-fighter is a man of mark and distinction. Montez
was regarded by the Spaniards of this generation with
nearly as much respect as Don Rodriguez de Bivar in the
days of the Moorish wars, to such a point has the vaunted
chivalry of Spain degenerated! Sometimes Spanish nobles
enter the arena, and brave peril and death for the sake of
the applause bestowed upon the successful <i>torero</i>, and
many lives are lost annually in this degrading sport.</p>

<p>Few professional bull-fighters reach an advanced age;
their career in the arena is almost always short, and they
cannot avoid receiving severe wounds in their dangerous
career. Pepe Illo, a famous Spanish picador, was wounded
no less than twenty-six times, and finally killed by a bull.
This man and another noted <i>torero</i>, named Romero, were
possessed of such undaunted courage, that, in order to excite
the interest of the spectators, they were accustomed to confront
the bull with fetters upon their feet. Another famous
picador in the annals of the arena was Juan Sevilla, who
on one occasion was charged furiously by an Andalusian bull
which overthrew both horse and rider. The savage animal,
finding that the legs of his fallen antagonist were so well
protected by the iron-ribbed hide of the pantaloons the bull-fighters
wear that it was impossible to make an impression on
them, lowered his horns with the intention of striking him
in the face; but the dauntless picador, seizing one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
bull's ears in his right hand, and thrusting the fingers of
the other into his nostrils, after a horrible struggle compelled
him to retire. Then, when every one looked to see
him borne out of the ring dying, he rose to his feet, called
for a fresh horse and lance, and bounding into the saddle,
attacked the bull in the centre of the ring, and driving the
iron up to the shaft in his neck, rolled him over dead.
"O," says an enthusiastic eye-witness of this prodigious
feat, "if you had heard the <i>vivas</i>, if you had witnessed
the frantic joy, the crazy ecstasy at the display of so
much courage and good fortune, like me you would have
envied the lot of Sevilla." Such are some of the dangers
and excitements of the bull-ring; such is the character of
some of the scenes which the gentle ladies of Cuba have
learned, not to endure, but to welcome with delight.</p>

<p>To look upon these ladies, you could not possibly imagine
that there was in them sufficient hardihood to witness such
exhibitions. They are almost universally handsome, in person
rather below the height of the sex with us, but with an
erect and dignified carriage, and with forms always rounded
to a delicate fullness, displaying a tendency to <i>enbonpoint</i>
quite perfection itself in point of model.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The hair is
always black and profuse, the complexion a light olive,
without a particle of carmine, the eyes&mdash;a match for the
hair in color&mdash;are large and beautifully expressive, with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
most irresistible dash of languor in them.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> It is really
difficult to conceive of a homely woman with such eyes as you
are sure to find them endowed with in Cuba. They have
been justly famed also for their graceful carriage, and, indeed,
it is the very poetry of motion, singular as it may
seem when it is remembered that for them to walk abroad is
such a rarity. It is not simply a progressive move, but the
harmonious play of features, the coquettish undulation
of the face, the exquisite disposition of costume, and modulation
of voice, rich, liquid and sweet as the nightingale's,
that engage the beholder, and lend a happy charm to the
majestic grace of every attitude and every step. It is a
union, a harmonious consort of all these elements, that so
beautifies the carriage of the Cuban ladies.</p>

<p>The men are, also, generally speaking, manly and good-looking,
though much lighter, smaller and more agile, than
the Americans. The lazy life that is so universally led by
them tends to make them less manly in physical development
than a life of activity would do. It seems to be an
acknowledged principle among them never to do that for
themselves that a slave can do for them,&mdash;a fact that is
very plainly demonstrated by the style of the volante, where
the little horse is made not only to draw after him the vehicle
and its contents, but also to carry upon his back a heavy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
negro, weighed down with jack-boots and livery, as a driver,
when a pair of reins extending from the bridle to the volante
would obviate all necessity for the negro's presence at
all. But a Creole or Spaniard would think it demeaning
to drive his own volante; the thing is never seen on the
island. The climate, we know, induces to this sense of ease.
With abundance of leisure, and the ever-present influences
of their genial clime, where the heart's blood leaps more
swiftly to the promptings of the imagination&mdash;where the
female form earliest attains its wonted beauty and longest
holds its sway over the heart&mdash;the West Indies seem peculiarly
adapted for romance and love. The consequent adventures
among the people are very numerous, and not,
oftentimes, without startling interest, affording such themes
and plots as a French <i>feuilletonist</i> might revel in. An
ungraceful woman is not to be found on the island; whether
bred in the humble cottage of the Montero, or in the luxuriant
mansion of the planter or citizen, she is sure to evince
all the ease and grace of polished life. Your heart is bound
to them at once, when on parting they give you kindly the
Spanish benediction, "Go, se&ntilde;or, in a good hour."</p>

<p>The nobility of Cuba, so called, is composed of rather
original material, to say the least of it, and forms rather
a funny "institution." There may be some thirty gentlemen
dubbed with the title of Marquis, and as many more
with that of Count, most of both classes having acquired
their wealth by the carrying on of extensive sugar planta<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>tions.
These are sneeringly designated by the humbler
classes as "sugar noblemen," nearly all of these aristocratic
gentlemen having bought their titles outright for money,
not the least consideration being had by the Spanish throne
as to the fitness of the individual even for this nominal
honor, save a due consideration for the amount of the would-be
noble's fortune. Twenty-five thousand dollars will purchase
either title. And yet, the tone of Cuban society may
be said to be eminently aristocratic, and, in certain circles,
very exclusive. The native of old Spain does not endeavor
to conceal his contempt of foreigners and the Creoles, shielding
his inferiority of intelligence under a cloak of hauteur;
and thus the Castilians and Creoles form two quite distinct
classes in the island,&mdash;a distinction which the home government
endeavor to foster and promote in every way, for
obvious reasons of their own.</p>

<p>The sugar planter, the coffee planter, the merchant, the
liberal professions and the literati (this last a meagre class
in numbers), stand about in the order in which we have
written them, as it regards their relative degrees or social
position, but wealth has the same charm here as in every
part of Christendom, and the millionaire has the entr&eacute;e to
all classes. The Monteros, or yeomanry of Cuba, inhabit
the less-cultivated portions of the soil, venturing into the
cities only to sell their surplus produce, acting as "market-men"
for the cities in the immediate neighborhood of
their homes. When they stir abroad they are always armed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
cap-a-pie with sword and pistols,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and, indeed, every one
carries arms upon the inland roads of Cuba. Formerly
this was a most indispensable precaution, though weapons
are now rarely brought into use. The arming of the Monteros,
however, has always been encouraged by the authorities,
as they thus form a sort of mounted militia at all times
available, and, indeed, not only the most effective, but about
the only available arm of defence against negro insurrections.
The Montero is rarely a slave-owner himself, but
frequently is engaged on the plantations during the busy
season as an extra overseer. He is generally a hard taskmaster
to the slave, having an intuitive hatred for the
blacks.</p>

<p>The Monteros<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> form an exceedingly important and interesting
class of the population of the island. They marry
very young,&mdash;the girls from thirteen to fifteen, the young
men from sixteen to twenty,&mdash;and almost universally rearing
large families. Their increase during the last twenty
years has been great, and they seem to be fast approaching
to a degree of importance that will make them, like the
American farmers, the bone and sinew of the land. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
great and glaring misfortune of their present situation, is
the want of intelligence and cultivation; books they have
none, nor, of course, schools. It is said that they have
been somewhat aroused, of late, from this condition of lethargy
concerning education, and that efforts are being made
among them to a considerable extent to afford their children
opportunity for instruction. Physically speaking, they are
a fine yeomanry, and, if they could be rendered intelligent,
would in time become what nature seems to have designed
them for,&mdash;the real masters of the country.</p>

<p>There is one fact highly creditable to the Monteros, and
that is their temperate habits, as it regards indulgence in
stimulating drinks. As a beverage, they do not use ardent
spirits, and seem to have no taste for the article, though at
times they join the stranger in a social glass. I doubt if
any visitor ever saw one of this class in the least intoxicated.
This being the fact, they are a very reliable people, and can
be counted upon in an emergency. As to the matter of
temperance, it needs no missionaries in the island, for probably
there is not so large a tract of territory in Europe or
America, as this island, where such a degree of temperance
is observed in the use of intoxicating drinks. Healths are
drunk at table, but in sparing draughts, while delicious
fruits fill up the time devoted to dessert.</p>

<p>There is probably but one vice that the Monteros may be
said to be addicted to, or which they often indulge in, and
that is one which is so natural to a Spaniard, and the appli<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>ances
for which are so constantly at hand, in the shape of
the cock-pit, that it is not a wonder he should be seduced by
the passion of gambling. Many of the more intelligent
avoid it altogether, but with others it appears to be a part
and parcel of their very existence. In the cities, as we
have already shown, the government encourage and patronize
the spirit of gaming, as they derive from its practice,

<p>The sugar plantations are the least attractive in external
appearance, but the most profitable, pecuniarily, of all
agricultural investments in the tropics. They spread out
their extensive fields of cane without any relief whatever to
the eye, save here and there the tall, majestic and glorious
palm bending gracefully over the undergrowth. The
income of some of the largest sugar plantations in Cuba is
set down as high as two hundred thousand dollars per
annum, the lowest perhaps exceeding one hundred thousand
dollars. Some of them still employ ox-power for grinding
the cane; but American steam-engines are fast taking the
place of animal power, and more or less are monthly exported
for this purpose from New York, Philadelphia and
Boston. This creates a demand for engineers and machin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>ists,
for whom the Cubans are also dependent upon this
country; and there are said to be at this time two hundred
Bostonians thus engaged, at a handsome remuneration,
upon the island. A Spaniard or Creole would as soon
attempt to fly as he would endeavor to learn how properly
to run a steam-engine. As this happens to be a duty that
it is not safe to entrust to even a faithful slave, he is therefore
obliged to send abroad for foreign skill, and to pay for
it in round numbers.</p>

<p>During the manufacturing season a large, well-managed
sugar plantation exhibits a scene of the utmost activity and
unremitting labor. The planter must "make hay while
the sun shines;" and when the cane is ripe no time must
be lost in expressing the juice. Where oxen are employed,
they often die of over-work before the close of the season,
and the slaves are allowed but five hours for sleep, though
during the rest of the year the task of the negroes is comparatively
light, and they may sleep ten hours if they
choose.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> In society, the sugar planter holds a higher rank
than the coffee planter, as we have indicated in the classification
already given; probably, however, merely as in the
scale of wealth, for it requires nearly twice the amount of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
capital to carry on the former that is required to perfect the
business of the latter, both in respect to the number of
hands and also as it relates to machinery. But, as the
sugar plantation surpasses the coffee in wealth, so the coffee
plantation surpasses, the sugar in every natural beauty and
attractiveness.</p>

<p>A coffee plantation is one of the most beautiful gardens
that can well be conceived of; in its variety and beauty
baffling correct description, being one of those peculiar
characteristics of the low latitudes which must be seen to be
understood. An estate devoted to this purpose usually
covers some three hundred acres of land, planted in regular
squares of eight acres, and intersected by broad alleys
of palms, mangoes, oranges, and other ornamental and
beautiful tropical trees.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Mingled with these are planted
lemons, pomegranates, cape jessamines, and a species of
wild heliotrope, fragrant as the morning. Conceive of this
beautiful arrangement, and then of the whole when in
flower; the coffee, with its milk-white blossoms, so abundant
that it seems as though a pure white cloud of snow
had fallen there and left the rest of the vegetation fresh and
green. Interspersed in these fragrant alleys is the red of
the Mexican rose, the flowering pomegranate, and the large,
gaudy flower of the penon, shrouding its parent stem in a
cloak of scarlet, with wavings here and there of the grace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>ful
yellow flag, and many bewitchingly-fragrant wild
flowers, twining their tender stems about the base of these.
In short, a coffee plantation is a perfect floral El Dorado,
with every luxury (except ice) the heart could wish. The
writer's experience was mainly gained upon the estate of
Dr. Finlay, a Scotch physician long resident in Cuba, and
who is a practising physician in Havana. He has named
his plantation, in accordance with the custom of the planters,
with a fancy title, and calls it pleasantly Buena Esperanza
(good hope).</p>

<p>The three great staples of production and exportation are
sugar, coffee and tobacco. The sugar-cane (<i>arundo saccharifera</i>)
is the great source of the wealth of the island.
Its culture requires, as we have remarked elsewhere, large
capital, involving as it does a great number of hands, and
many buildings, machines, teams, etc. We are not aware
that any attempt has ever been made to refine it on the
island. The average yield of a sugar plantation affords a
profit of about fifteen per cent. on the capital invested.
Improved culture and machinery have vastly increased the
productiveness of the sugar plantations. In 1775 there
were four hundred and fifty-three mills, and the crops did
not yield quite one million three hundred thousand <i>arrobas</i>
(an arroba is twenty-five pounds). Fifty years later, a
thousand mills produced eight million arrobas; that is to
say, each mill produced six times more sugar. The Cuban
sugar has the preference in all the markets of Europe. Its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
manufacture yields, besides, molasses, which forms an
important article of export. A liquor, called <i>aguadiente</i>,
is manufactured in large quantities from the molasses.
There are several varieties of cane cultivated on the island.
The Otaheitian cane is very much valued. A plantation
of sugar-cane requires renewal once in about seven years.
The canes are about the size of a walking-stick, are cut off
near the root, and laid in piles, separated from the tops,
and then conveyed in carts to the sugar-mill, where they
are unladen. Women are employed to feed the mills,
which is done by throwing the canes into a sloping trough,
from which they pass between the mill-stones and are
ground entirely dry. The motive power is supplied either
by mules and oxen, or by steam. Steam machinery is
more and more extensively employed, the best machines
being made in the vicinity of Boston. The dry canes, after
the extraction of the juice, are conveyed to a suitable place
to be spread out and exposed to the action of the sun; after
which they are employed as fuel in heating the huge boilers
in which the cane-juice is received, after passing through
the tank, where it is purified, lime-water being there employed
to neutralize any free acid and separate vegetable
matters. The granulation and crystallization is effected in
large flat pans. After this, it is broken up or crushed,
and packed in hogsheads or boxes for exportation. A plantation
is renewed by laying the green canes horizontally in
the ground, when new and vigorous shoots spring up from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
every joint, exhibiting the almost miraculous fertility of the
soil of Cuba under all circumstances.</p>

<p>The coffee-plant (<i>caffea Arabica</i>) is less extensively
cultivated on the island than formerly, being found to yield
only four per cent. on the capital invested. This plant
was introduced by the French into Martinique in 1727,
and made its appearance in Cuba in 1769. It requires
some shade, and hence the plantations are, as already described,
diversified by alternate rows of bananas, and other
useful and ornamental tropical shrubs and trees. The decadence
of this branch of agriculture was predicted for
years before it took place, the fall of prices being foreseen;
but the calculations of intelligent men were disregarded,
simply because they interfered with their own estimate
of profits. When the crash came, many coffee raisers
entirely abandoned the culture, while the wiser among them
introduced improved methods and economy into their business,
and were well rewarded for their foresight and good
judgment. The old method of culture was very careless
and defective. The plants were grown very close together,
and subjected to severe pruning, while the fruit, gathered
by hand, yielded a mixture of ripe and unripe berries. In
the countries where the coffee-plant originated, a very different
method is pursued. The Arabs plant the trees much
further apart, allow them to grow to a considerable height,
and gather the crop by shaking the trees, a method which
secures only the ripe berries. A coffee plantation managed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
in this way, and combined with the culture of vegetables
and fruits on the same ground, would yield, it is said, a
dividend of twelve per cent. on the capital employed; but
the Cuban agriculturists have not yet learned to develop
the resources of their favored island.</p>

<p><i>Tobacco.</i> This plant (<i>nicotiana tabacum</i>) is indigenous
to America, but the most valuable is that raised in
Cuba. Its cultivation is costly, for it requires a new soil
of uncommon fertility, and a great amount of heat. It is
very exhausting to the land. It does not, it is true,
require much labor, nor costly machinery and implements.
It is valued according to the part of the island in which it
grows. That of greatest value and repute, used in the
manufacture of the high cost cigars, is grown in the most
westerly part of the island, known popularly as the <i>Vuelta
de Abajo</i>. But the whole western portion of the island is
not capable of producing tobacco of the best quality. The
region of superior tobacco is comprised within a parallelogram
of twenty-nine degrees by seven. Beyond this, up
to the meridian of Havana, the tobacco is of fine color, but
inferior aroma (the Countess Merlin calls this aroma the
vilest of smells); and the former circumstance secures it
the preference of foreigners. From Consolacion to San
Christoval, the tobacco is very hot, in the language of the
growers, but harsh and strong, and from San Christoval to
Guanajay, with the exception of the district of Las Virtudes,
the tobacco is inferior, and continues so up to Hol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>guin
y Cuba, where we find a better quality. The fertile
valley of Los Guines produces poor smoking tobacco, but
an article excellent for the manufacture of snuff. On the
banks of the Rio San Sebastian are also some lands which
yield the best tobacco in the whole island. From this it
may be inferred how great an influence the soil produces on
the good quality of Cuban tobacco; and this circumstance
operates more strongly and directly than the slight differences
of climate and position produced by immediate localities.
Perhaps a chemical analysis of the soils of the Vuelta
de Abajo would enable the intelligent cultivator to supply
to other lands in the island the ingredients wanting to
produce equally good tobacco. The cultivators in the
Vuelta de Abajo are extremely skilful, though not scientific.
The culture of tobacco yields about seven per cent.
on the capital invested, and is not considered to be so profitable
on the island as of yore.</p>

<p>Cacao, rice, plantains, indigo, cotton, sago, yuca (a farinaceous
plant, eaten like potatoes), Indian corn, and many
other vegetable productions, might be cultivated to a much
greater extent and with larger profit than they yield. We
are astonished to find that with the inexhaustible fertility of
the soil, with an endless summer, that gives the laborer two
and three crops of some articles a year, agriculture generally
yields a lower per centage than in our stern northern
latitudes. The yield of a <i>caballeria</i> (thirty-two and seven-tenths
acres) is as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>It must be remembered that there are multitudes of
fruits and vegetable productions not enumerated above,
which do not enter into commerce, and which grow wild.
No account is taken of them. In the hands of a thrifty
population, Cuba would blossom like a rose, as it is a garden
growing wild, cultivated here and there in patches, but
capable of supporting in ease a population of ten times its
density.</p>

<p>About the coffee plantations, and, indeed, throughout the
rural parts of the island, there is an insect called a cucullos,
answering in its nature to our fire-fly, though quadruple its
size, which floats in phosphorescent clouds over the vegetation.
One at first sight is apt to compare them to a shower
of stars. They come in multitudes, immediately after the
wet or rainy season sets in, and there is consequently great
rejoicing among the slaves and children, as well as children
of a larger growth. They are caught by the slaves and
confined in tiny cages of wicker, giving them sufficient light
for convenience in their cabins at night, and, indeed, forming
all the lamps they are permitted to have. Many are
brought into the city and sold by the young Creoles, a half-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>dozen
for a paseta (twenty-five cents). Ladies not unfrequently
carry a small cage of silver attached to their bracelets,
containing four or five of them, and the light thus
emitted is like a candle. Some ladies wear a belt of them
at night, ingeniously fastened about the waist, and sometimes
even a necklace, the effect thus produced being highly
amusing. In the ball-rooms they are sometimes worn in
the flounces of the ladies' dresses, and they seem nearly as
brilliant as diamonds. Strangely enough, there is a natural
hook near the head of the Cuban fire-fly, by which it can
be attached to any part of the dress without any apparent
injury to the insect itself; this the writer has seen apparently
demonstrated, though, of course, it could not be
strictly made clear. The town ladies pet these cucullos,
and feed them regularly with sugar cane, of which the
insects partake with infinite relish; but on the plantations,
when a fresh supply is wanted, they have only to wait until
the twilight deepens, and a myriad can be secured without
trouble.</p>

<p>The Cubans have a queer, but yet excellent mode of
harnessing their oxen, similar to that still in vogue among
eastern countries. The yoke is placed behind the horns,
at the roots, and so fastened to them with thongs that they
draw, or, rather, push by them, without chafing. The
animals always have a hole perforated in their nostrils,
through which a rope is passed, serving as reins, and rendering
them extremely tractable; the wildest and most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
stubborn animals are completely subdued by this mode of
controlling them, and can be led unresisting anywhere.
This mode of harnessing seems to enable the animal to bring
more strength to bear upon the purpose for which he is
employed, than when the yoke is placed, as is the case with
us, about the throat and shoulders. It is laid down in
natural history that the greatest strength of horned animals
lies in the head and neck, but, in placing the yoke on the
breast, we get it out of reach of both head and neck, and
the animal draws the load behind by the mere force of the
weight and impetus of body, as given by the limbs.
Wouldn't it be worth while to break a yoke of steers to this
mode, and test the matter at the next Connecticut ploughing-match?
We merely suggest the thing.</p>

<p>The Cuban horse deserves more than a passing notice in
this connection. He is a remarkably valuable animal.
Though small and delicate of limb, he can carry a great
weight; and his gait is a sort of <i>march</i>, something
like our pacing horses, and remarkably easy under the
saddle. They have great power of endurance, are small
eaters, and very docile and easy to take care of. The
Montero inherits all the love of his Moorish ancestors
for the horse, and never stirs abroad without him. He
considers himself established for life when he possesses a
good horse, a sharp Toledo blade, and a pair of silver spurs,
and from very childhood is accustomed to the saddle.
They tell you long stories of their horses, and would make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
them descended direct from the Kochlani,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> if you will permit
them. Their size may readily be arrived at from the
fact that they rarely weigh over six hundred pounds; but
they are very finely proportioned.</p>

<p>The visitor, as he passes inland, will frequently observe
upon the fronts of the clustering dwelling-houses attempts
at representations of birds and various animals, looking
like anything but what they are designed to depict, the
most striking characteristic being the gaudy coloring and
remarkable size. Pigeons present the colossal appearance
of ostriches, and dogs are exceedingly elephantine in their
proportions. Especially in the suburbs of Havana may
this queer fancy be observed to a great extent, where
attempts are made to depict domestic scenes, and the persons
of either sex engaged in appropriate occupations. If
such ludicrous objects were met with anywhere else but in
Cuba, they would be called caricatures, but here they are
regarded with the utmost complacency, and innocently considered
as ornamental.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Somehow this is a very general
passion among the humbler classes, and is observable in the
vicinity of Matanzas and Cardenas, as well as far inland, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
the small hamlets. The exterior of the town houses is
generally tinted blue, or some brown color, to protect the
eyes of the inhabitants from the powerful reflection of the
ever-shining sun.</p>

<p>One of the most petty and annoying experiences that the
traveller upon the island is sure to meet with, is the arbitrary
tax of time, trouble and money to which he is sure
to be subjected by the petty officials of every rank in the
employment of government; for, by a regular and legalized
system of arbitrary taxation upon strangers, a large revenue
is realized. Thus, the visitor is compelled to pay
some five dollars for a landing permit, and a larger sum,
say seven dollars, to get away again. If he desires to pass
out of the city where he has landed, a fresh permit and
passport are required, at a further expense, though you
bring one from home signed by the Spanish consul of the
port where you embarked, and have already been adjudged
by the local authorities. Besides all this, you are watched,
and your simplest movements noted down and reported
daily to the captain of police, who takes the liberty of stopping
and examining all your newspapers, few of which are
ever permitted to be delivered to their address; and, if you
are thought to be a suspicious person, your letters, like
your papers, are unhesitatingly devoted to "government
purposes."</p>

<p>An evidence of the jealous care which is exercised to
prevent strangers from carrying away any information in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
detail relative to the island, was evinced to the writer in a
tangible form on one occasion in the Paseo de Isabella. A
young French artist had opened his portfolio, and was
sketching one of the prominent statues that grace the spot,
when an officer stepped up to him, and, taking possession of
his pencil and other materials, conducted him at once before
some city official within the walls of Havana. Here he was
informed that he could not be allowed to sketch even a tree
without a permit signed by the captain-general. As this
was the prominent object of the Frenchman's visit to the
island, and as he was really a professional artist sketching
for self-improvement, he succeeded, after a while, in convincing
the authorities of these facts, and he was then, as a
great favor, supplied with a permit (for which he was compelled
to pay an exorbitant fee), which guaranteed to him
the privilege of sketching, with certain restrictions as to
fortifications, military posts, and harbor views; the same,
however, to expire after ninety days from the date.</p>

<p>The great value and wealth of the island has been kept
comparatively secret by this Japan-like watchfulness; and
hence, too, the great lack of reliable information, statistical
or otherwise, relating to its interests, commerce, products,
population, modes and rates of taxation, etc. Jealous to
the very last degree relative to the possession of Cuba, the
home government has exhausted its ingenuity in devising
restrictions upon its inhabitants; while, with a spirit of
avarice also goaded on by necessity, it has yearly added to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the burthen of taxation upon the people to an unparalleled
extent. The cord <i>may</i> be severed, and the overstrained
bow will spring back to its native and upright position!
The Cubans are patient and long-suffering, that is sufficiently
obvious to all; and yet Spain may break the
camel's back by one more feather!</p>

<p>The policy that has suppressed all statistical information,
all historical record of the island, all accounts of its current
prosperity and growth, is a most short-sighted one, and as
unavailing in its purpose as it would be to endeavor to keep
secret the diurnal revolutions of the earth. No official
public chart of the harbor of Havana has ever been issued
by the Spanish government, no maps of it given by the
home government as authentic; they would draw a screen
over this tropical jewel, lest its dazzling brightness should
tempt the cupidity of some other nation. All this effort at
secrecy is little better than childishness on their part, since
it is impossible, with all their precautions, to keep these
matters secret. It is well known that our war department
at Washington contains faithful sectional and complete
drawings of every important fortification in Cuba, and even
the most reliable charts and soundings of its harbors, bays
and seaboard generally.</p>

<p>The political condition of Cuba is precisely what might
be expected of a Castilian colony thus ruled, and governed
by such a policy. Like the home government, she presents
a remarkable instance of stand-still policy; and from one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
of the most powerful kingdoms, and one of the most
wealthy, is now the humblest and poorest. Other nations
have labored and succeeded in the race of progress, while
her adherence to ancient institutions, and her dignified
scorn of "modern innovations," amount in fact to a species
of retrogression, which has placed her far below all her
sister governments of Europe. The true Hidalgo spirit,
which wraps itself up in an antique garb, and shrugs its
shoulders at the advance of other countries, still rules over
the beautiful realm of Ferdinand and Isabella, and its
high-roads still boast their banditti and worthless gipsies,
as a token of the declining power of the Castilian crown.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<h4>TACON'S SUMMARY MODE OF JUSTICE.</h4>


<p>Probably of all the governors-general that have filled
the post in Cuba none is better known abroad, or has left
more monuments of his enterprise, than Tacon. His reputation
at Havana is of a somewhat doubtful character; for,
though he followed out with energy the various improvements
suggested by Aranjo, yet his modes of procedure
were so violent, that he was an object of terror to the people
generally, rather than of gratitude. He vastly improved
the appearance of the capital and its vicinity, built
the new prison, rebuilt the governor's palace, constructed
a military road to the neighboring forts, erected a spacious
theatre and market-house (as related in connection with
Marti), arranged a new public walk, and opened a vast
parade ground without the city walls, thus laying the foundation
of the new city which has now sprung up in this formerly
desolate suburb. He suppressed the gaming-houses,
and rendered the streets, formerly infested with robbers, as
secure as those of Boston or New York. But all this was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
done with a bold military arm. Life was counted of little
value, and many of the first people fell before his orders.</p>

<p>Throughout all his career, there seemed ever to be within
him a romantic love of justice, and a desire to administer it
impartially; and some of the stories, well authenticated,
illustrating this fact, are still current in Havana. One of
these, as characteristic of Tacon and his rule, is given in
this connection, as nearly in the words of the narrator as the
writer can remember them, listened to in "La Dominica's."</p>

<p>During the first year of Tacon's governorship, there was
a young Creole girl, named Miralda Estalez, who kept a
little cigar-store in the <i>Calle de Mercaderes</i>, and whose
shop was the resort of all the young men of the town who
loved a choicely-made and superior cigar. Miralda was
only seventeen, without mother or father living, and earned
an humble though sufficient support by her industry in the
manufactory we have named, and by the sales of her little
store. She was a picture of ripened tropical beauty, with a
finely rounded form, a lovely face, of soft, olive tint, and
teeth that a Tuscarora might envy her. At times, there
was a dash of languor in her dreamy eye that would have
warmed an anchorite; and then her cheerful jests were so
delicate, yet free, that she had unwittingly turned the heads,
not to say hearts, of half the young merchants in the
<i>Calle de Mercaderes</i>. But she dispensed her favors without
partiality; none of the rich and gay exquisites of
Havana could say they had ever received any particular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
acknowledgment from the fair young girl to their warm and
constant attention. For this one she had a pleasant smile,
for another a few words of pleasing gossip, and for a third
a snatch of a Spanish song; but to none did she give her
confidence, except to young Pedro Mantanez, a fine-looking
boatman, who plied between the Punta and Moro Castle,
on the opposite side of the harbor.</p>

<p>Pedro was a manly and courageous young fellow, rather
above his class in intelligence, appearance and associations,
and pulled his oars with a strong arm and light heart, and
loved the beautiful Miralda with an ardor romantic in its
fidelity and truth. He was a sort of leader among the boatmen
of the harbor for reason of his superior cultivation and
intelligence, and his quick-witted sagacity was often turned
for the benefit of his comrades. Many were the noble deeds
he had done in and about the harbor since a boy, for he had
followed his calling of a waterman from boyhood, as his
fathers had done before him. Miralda in turn ardently
loved Pedro; and, when he came at night and sat in the
back part of her little shop, she had always a neat and fragrant
cigar for his lips. Now and then, when she could
steal away from her shop on some holiday, Pedro would
hoist a tiny sail in the prow of his boat, and securing the
little stern awning over Miralda's head, would steer out into
the gulf, and coast along the romantic shore.</p>

<p>There was a famous rou&eacute;, well known at this time in
Havana, named Count Almonte, who had frequently visited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
Miralda's shop, and conceived quite a passion for the girl,
and, indeed, he had grown to be one of her most liberal
customers. With a cunning shrewdness and knowledge of
human nature, the count besieged the heart of his intended
victim without appearing to do so, and carried on his plan
of operations for many weeks before the innocent girl even
suspected his possessing a partiality for her, until one day
she was surprised by a present from him of so rare and
costly a nature as to lead her to suspect the donor's intentions
at once, and to promptly decline the offered gift.
Undismayed by this, still the count continued his profuse
patronage in a way to which Miralda could find no plausible
pretext of complaint.</p>

<p>At last, seizing upon what he considered a favorable
moment, Count Almonte declared his passion to Miralda,
besought her to come and be the mistress of his broad and
rich estates at Cerito, near the city, and offered all the
promises of wealth, favor and fortune; but in vain. The
pure-minded girl scorned his offer, and bade him never more
to insult her by visiting her shop. Abashed but not confounded,
the count retired, but only to weave a new snare
whereby he could entangle her, for he was not one to be so
easily thwarted.</p>

<p>One afternoon, not long after this, as the twilight was
settling over the town, a file of soldiers halted just opposite
the door of the little cigar-shop, when a young man,
wearing a lieutenant's insignia, entered, and asked the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
attendant if her name was Miralda Estalez, to which she
timidly responded.</p>

<p>"Then you will please to come with me."</p>

<p>"By what authority?" asked the trembling girl.</p>

<p>"The order of the governor-general."</p>

<p>"Then I must obey you," she answered; and prepared
to follow him at once.</p>

<p>Stepping to the door with her, the young officer directed
his men to march on; and, getting into a volante, told
Miralda they would drive to the guard-house. But, to the
surprise of the girl, she soon after discovered that they
were rapidly passing the city gates, and immediately after
were dashing off on the road to Cerito. Then it was that
she began to fear some trick had been played upon her; and
these fears were soon confirmed by the volante's turning
down the long alley of palms that led to the estate of Count
Almonte. It was in vain to expostulate now; she felt that
she was in the power of the reckless nobleman, and the pretended
officer and soldiers were his own people, who had
adopted the disguise of the Spanish army uniform.</p>

<p>Count Almonte met her at the door, told her to fear no
violence, that her wishes should be respected in all things
save her personal liberty,&mdash;that he trusted, in time, to persuade
her to look more favorably upon him, and that in all
things he was her slave. She replied contemptuously to his
words, and charged him with the cowardly trick by which
he had gained control of her liberty. But she was left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
by herself, though watched by his orders at all times to prevent
her escape.</p>

<p>She knew very well that the power and will of Count
Almonte were too strong for any humble friend of hers to
attempt to thwart; and yet she somehow felt a conscious
strength in Pedro, and secretly cherished the idea that he
would discover her place of confinement, and adopt some
means to deliver her. The stiletto is the constant companion
of the lower classes, and Miralda had been used to wear
one even in her store against contingency; but she now
regarded the tiny weapon with peculiar satisfaction, and
slept with it in her bosom!</p>

<p>Small was the clue by which Pedro Mantanez discovered
the trick of Count Almonte. First this was found out,
then that circumstance, and these, being put together, they
led to other results, until the indefatigable lover was at last
fully satisfied that he had discovered her place of confinement.
Disguised as a friar of the order of San Felipe, he
sought Count Almonte's gates at a favorable moment, met
Miralda, cheered her with fresh hopes, and retired to
arrange some certain plan for her delivery. There was
time to think <i>now</i>; heretofore he had not permitted himself
even an hour's sleep; but she was safe,&mdash;that is, not in
immediate danger,&mdash;and he could breathe more freely. He
knew not with whom to advise; he feared to speak to those
above him in society, lest they might betray his purpose to
the count, and his own liberty, by some means, be thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
jeopardized. He could only consider with himself; he must
be his own counsellor in this critical case.</p>

<p>At last, as if in despair, he started to his feet, one day,
and exclaimed to himself, "Why not go to head-quarters at
once? why not see the governor-general, and tell him the
whole truth? Ah! see him?&mdash;how is that to be effected?
And then this Count Almonte is a <i>nobleman</i>! They say
Tacon loves justice. We shall see. I <i>will</i> go to the governor-general;
it cannot do any harm, if it does not do
any good. I can but try." And Pedro did seek the governor.
True, he did not at once get audience of him,&mdash;not
the first, nor the second, nor third time: but he persevered,
and was admitted at last. Here he told his story in a free,
manly voice, undisguisedly and open in all things, so that
Tacon was pleased.</p>

<p>"And the girl?" asked the governor-general, over whose
countenance a dark scowl had gathered. "Is she thy sister?"</p>

<p>"No, Excelencia, she is dearer still; she is my betrothed."</p>

<p>The governor, bidding him come nearer, took a golden
cross from his table, and, handing it to the boatman, as he
regarded him searchingly, said,</p>

<p>"Swear that what you have related to me is true, as you
hope for heaven!"</p>

<p>"I swear!" said Pedro, kneeling and kissing the emblem
with simple reverence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>The governor turned to his table, wrote a few brief lines,
and, touching a bell, summoned a page from an adjoining
room, whom he ordered to send the captain of the guard to
him. Prompt as were all who had any connection with the
governor's household, the officer appeared at once, and
received the written order, with directions to bring Count
Almonte and a young girl named Miralda immediately
before him. Pedro was sent to an anteroom, and the business
of the day passed on as usual in the reception-hall of
the governor.</p>

<p>Less than two hours had transpired when the count and
Miralda stood before Tacon. Neither knew, the nature of
the business which had summoned them there. Almonte
half suspected the truth, and the poor girl argued to herself
that her fate could not but be improved by the interference,
let its nature be what it might.</p>

<p>"Count Almonte, you doubtless know why I have ordered
you to appear here."</p>

<p>"Excelencia, I fear that I have been indiscreet," was
the reply.</p>

<p>"You adopted the uniform of the guards for your own
private purposes upon this young girl, did you not?"</p>

<p>"Excelencia, I cannot deny it."</p>

<p>"Declare, upon your honor, Count Almonte, whether
she is unharmed whom you have thus kept a prisoner."</p>

<p>"Excelencia, she is as pure as when she entered beneath
my roof," was the truthful reply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>The governor turned, and whispered something to his
page, then continued his questions to the count, while he
made some minutes upon paper. Pedro was now summoned
to explain some matter, and, as he entered, the governor-general
turned his back for one moment as if to seek for
some papers upon his table, while Miralda was pressed in
the boatman's arms. It was but for a moment, and the
next, Pedro was bowing humbly before Tacon. A few
moments more and the governor's page returned, accompanied
by a monk of the church of Santa Clara, with the
emblems of his office.</p>

<p>"Holy father," said Tacon, "you will bind the hands
of this Count Almonte and Miralda Estalez together in the
bonds of wedlock!"</p>

<p>"Excelencia!" exclaimed the count, in amazement.</p>

<p>"Not a word, Se&ntilde;or; it is your part to obey!"</p>

<p>"My nobility, Excelencia!"</p>

<p>"Is forfeited!" said Tacon.</p>

<p>Count Almonte had too many evidences before his mind's
eye of Tacon's mode of administering justice and of enforcing
his own will to dare to rebel, and he doggedly yielded
in silence. Poor Pedro, not daring to speak, was half-crazed
to see the prize he had so long coveted thus about to
be torn from him. In a few moments the ceremony was
performed, the trembling and bewildered girl not daring to
thwart the governor's orders, and the priest declared them
husband and wife. The captain of the guard was summoned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
and despatched with some written order, and, in a few subsequent
moments, Count Almonte, completely subdued and
broken-spirited, was ordered to return to his plantation.
Pedro and Miralda were directed to remain in an adjoining
apartment to that which had been the scene of this singular
procedure. Count Almonte mounted his horse, and, with a
single attendant, soon passed out of the city gates. But
hardly had he passed the corner of the Paseo, when a dozen
musketeers fired a volley upon him, and he fell a corpse
upon the road!</p>

<p>His body was quietly removed, and the captain of the
guard, who had witnessed the act, made a minute upon his
order as to the time and place, and, mounting his horse,
rode to the governor's palace, entering the presence chamber
just as Pedro and Miralda were once more summoned
before the governor.</p>

<p>"Excelencia," said the officer, returning the order, "it
is executed!"</p>

<p>"Is the count dead?"</p>

<p>"Excelencia, yes."</p>

<p>"Proclaim, in the usual manner, the marriage of Count
Almonte and Miralda Estalez, and also that she is his legal
widow, possessed of his titles and estates. See that a proper
officer attends her to the count's estate, and enforces this
decision." Then, turning to Pedro Mantanez, he said, "No
man nor woman in this island is so humble but that they
may claim justice of Tacon!"</p>

<p>The story furnishes its own moral.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>The consumption of tobacco,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> in the form of cigars, is
absolutely enormous in the island. Every man, woman and
child, seems to smoke; and it strikes one as rather peculiar,
to say the least of it, to see a lady smoking her cigarito in
the parlor, or on the verandah; but this is very common.
The men, of all degrees, smoke, and smoke everywhere; in
the houses, in the street, in the theatre, in the caf&eacute;s, in the
counting-room; eating, drinking, and, truly, it would seem,
sleeping, they smoke, smoke, smoke. The slave and his
master, the maid and her mistress, boy and man,&mdash;all, all
smoke; and it is really odd that vessels don't scent Havana
far out at sea before they heave in sight of its headlands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
No true Havanese ever moves a foot without his portable
armory of cigars, as indispensable to him as is his quiver to
the wild Indian, and he would feel equally lost without it.
Some one has facetiously said that the cigar ought to be the
national emblem of Cuba.</p>

<p>The gentlemen consume from ten to twelve cigars per
day, and many of the women half that number, saying
nothing of the juvenile portion of the community. The
consequence of this large and increasing consumption,
including the heavy export of the article, is to employ a
vast number of hands in the manufacture of cigars, and the
little stores and stalls where they are made are plentifully
sprinkled all over the city, at every corner and along the
principal streets. It is true that the ladies of the best
classes in Havana have abandoned the practice of smoking,
or at least they have ostensibly done so, never indulging
absolutely in public; but the writer has seen a noted beauty
whose teeth were much discolored by the oil which is engendered
in the use of the paper cigars, thus showing that,
although they no longer smoke in public, yet the walls of
their boudoirs are no strangers to the fumes of tobacco.
This is the only form in which the weed is commonly used
here. You rarely meet a snuff-taker, and few, if any, chew
tobacco. It is astonishing how passionately fond of smoking
the negroes become; with heavy pipes, well filled, they
inhale the rich narcotic, driving it out at the nostrils in a
slow, heavy stream, and half dozing over the dreamy and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
exhilarating process. They are fully indulged in this taste
by their masters, whether in town, or inland upon the plantations.
The postilions who wait for fare in the streets
pass four-fifths of their time in this way, and dream over
their pipes of pure Havana.</p>

<p>We can have but a poor idea, at the north, of tropical
fruits, for only a portion of them are of a nature to admit
of exportation, and those must be gathered in an unripe
condition in order to survive a short sea voyage. The
orange in Boston, and the orange in Havana, are vastly different;
the former has been picked green and ripened on
ship-board, the latter was on the tree a few hours before you
purchased it, and ripened upon its native stem. So of the
bananas, one of the most delightful of all West India fruits,
and which grow everywhere in Cuba with prodigal profuseness.
The principal fruits of the island are the banana,
mango, pomegranate, orange, pine-apple,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> zapota, tamarind,
citron, fig, cocoa, lemon, rose-apple and bread-fruit. Though
any of these are eaten freely of at all hours, yet the orange
seems to be the Creole's favorite, and he seldom rises from
his bed in the morning until he has drank his cup of strong
coffee, and eaten three or four oranges, brought fresh and
prepared to him by a slave. The practice is one which the
visitor falls very naturally into, and finds most agreeable.
They have a saying that "the orange is gold in the morn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>ing,
silver at noon, and lead at night." The most singular
of these varieties of fruits (by no means embracing all) is
the rose-apple, which, when eaten, has the peculiar and very
agreeable flavor of otto of rose, and this is so strong that to
eat more than one at a time is almost unpleasant. It has a
very sweet taste, and flavors some soups finely. Of these
fruit trees, the lemon is decidedly the most ornamental and
pretty, for, though small and dwarfish, like the American
quince, yet it hangs with flowers, small lemons, and ripe
fruit, all together, reminding one of the eastern <i>Alma</i>,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
and forming an uncommon and beautiful sight. This agreeable
phenomenon will surprise you at every turn upon the
coffee plantations.</p>

<p>But the article of food most required in the island is
flour, while the importation of it is made so unreasonably
expensive as to amount to a positive prohibition upon the
article. On foreign flour there is a fixed duty of <i>ten dollars</i>,
to which if we add the one and a half per cent., with
other regular charges, the duty will amount to about ten
dollars and fifty cents per barrel. This enormous tax on
flour prevents its use altogether in the island, except by the
wealthier classes. True, there is a home-made, Spanish
article, far inferior, which costs somewhat less, being imported
from far-off Spain without the prohibitory clause.
The estimate of the consumption of flour in this country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
gives one and a half barrel per head, per annum; but let
us suppose that the free population consume but one. The
free population&mdash;that is, the whites exclusively, not including
the large number of free negroes&mdash;numbers over
six hundred thousand; if the island belonged to this country,
there would immediately arise a demand for six hundred
thousand barrels of flour per annum, for the duty would no
longer exist as a prohibition upon this necessary article. At
four dollars and fifty cents per barrel, this would make the
sum of two million seven hundred thousand dollars; and if
we allow half a barrel each to the slaves and free blacks,
which would be the natural result, being not only the best
but cheapest food, we have an annual demand of from four
to five hundred thousand barrels more of the great staple
production of the United States. This is an item worth
considering by political economists. At the present time,
the imports into this country from thence exceed our exports
to Cuba to the amount of nearly one million of dollars
annually.</p>

<p>But we were writing of the vegetable productions of the
island, when this digression occurred.</p>

<p>The Royal Palm is the noblest tree of Cuba, rising from
thirty to fifty feet, and sometimes even twice this height,
with a straight stem, while from the top spring the broad
and beautiful leaves, in a knot, like a plume of ostrich
feathers. The bark is equally divided by ornamental ringlets
encircling it, each one marking a year of its age. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
peculiarity of this tree is, that it has no substance in the interior
of the trunk,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> yet the outside, to the thickness of an
inch and more, makes the finest of boards, and, when seasoned,
will turn a board nail with one stroke of the hammer.
The top of the palm yields a vegetable which is much used
upon the table, and, when boiled, resembles in flavor our
cauliflower. The cocoanut tree very much resembles the
palm, the branches diverging, like the ribs of an umbrella,
from one common centre, among which the fruit hangs in
tempting clusters far out of reach from the ground. The
plantain, with its profuse clusters of finger-like fruit, grows
low like the banana, which it vastly resembles, and the entire
trunk of both are renewed yearly; the old stock, after
yielding its crop, decaying rapidly, and forming the most
nutritious matter for the soil that can be had. Many of
the hedges through the plantations are formed of aloes, of
a large and luxuriant growth, with dagger-like points, and
stiff, long leaves, bidding defiance to ingress or egress, yet
ever ornamented with a fragrant cup-like flower. Lime
hedges are also very abundant, with their clusters of white
blossoms, and there is a vast supply of mahogany and other
precious woods, in the extensive forests.</p>

<p>It is somewhat remarkable that there is not a poisonous
reptile or animal of any sort in Cuba. Snakes of various<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
species abound, but are said to be perfectly inoffensive,
though sometimes destructive to domestic fowls. During a
pleasant trip between San Antonio and Alquizar, in a volante
with a planter, this subject happened to be under discussion,
when the writer discovered a snake, six feet long,
and as large at the middle as his arm, directly before the
volante. On suddenly exclaiming, and pointing it out, the
planter merely replied by giving its species, and declaring
that a child might sleep with it unharmed. In the meantime,
it was a relief to see the <i>innocent</i> creature hasten out
of the way and secrete itself in a neighboring hedge. Lizards,
tarantulas and chameleons, abound, but are considered
harmless. The writer has awakened in the morning and
found several lizards creeping on the walls of his apartment.
Only one small quadruped is found in Cuba that is supposed
to be indigenous, and that is called the hutia, much
resembling a mouse, but without the tail.</p>

<p>The Cuban blood-hound, of which we hear so much, is
not a native of the island, but belongs to an imported breed,
resembling the English mastiff, though with longer nose and
limbs. He is naturally a fierce, blood-thirsty animal, but
the particular qualities which fit him for tracing the runaway
slaves are wholly acquired by careful and expert
training. This training of the hounds to fit them for following
and securing the runaway negroes is generally entrusted
to a class of men who go about from one plantation
to another, and who are usually Monteros or French over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>seers
out of employment. Each plantation keeps more or
less of these dogs, more as a precautionary measure, however,
than for actual use, for so certain is the slave that he
will be instantly followed as soon as he is missed, and easily
traced by the hounds, of whose instinct he is fully aware,
that he rarely attempts to escape from his master. In one
respect this acts as a positive advantage to the negroes themselves,
for the master, feeling a confidence relative to their
possession and faithfulness, and well knowing the ease with
which they can at once be secured should they run away,
is thus enabled to leave them comparatively free to roam
about the plantation, and they undergo no surveillance except
during working hours, when an overseer is of course
always somewhere about, looking after them, and prompting
those that are indolent.</p>

<p>The blood-hounds are taken when quite young, tied up
securely, and a negro boy is placed to tease and annoy
them, occasionally administering a slight castigation upon
the animals, taking care to keep out of the reach of their
teeth. This whipping is generally administered under the
direction of the trainer, who takes good care that it shall
not be sufficiently severe to really hurt the dogs or crush
their spirit of resistance. As the dogs grow older, negro
men, in place of boys, are placed to fret and irritate them,
occasionally administering, as before, slight castigations upon
the dogs, but under the same restrictions; and they also resort
to the most ingenious modes of vexing the animals to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
the utmost, until the very sight of a negro will make them
howl. Finally, after a slave has worried them to the
last degree, he is given a good start, and the ground is
marked beforehand, a tree being selected, when the dogs
are let loose after him. Of course they pursue him
with open jaws and the speed of the wind; but the slave
climbs the tree, and is secure from the vengeance of the
animals.</p>

<p>This is the exact position in which the master desires
them to place his runaway slave&mdash;"tree him," and then
set up a howl that soon brings up the hunters. They are
never set upon the slaves to bite or injure them, but only
placed upon their track to follow and hunt them. So perfect
of scent are these animals, that the master, when he is
about to pursue a runaway, will find some clothing, however
slight, which the missing slave has left behind him, and
giving it to the hounds to smell, can then rely upon them to
follow the slave through whole plantations of his class, none
of whom they will molest, but, with their noses to the
ground, will lead straight to the woods, or wherever the
slave has sought shelter. On the plantations these dogs
are always kept chained when not in actual use, the negroes
not being permitted to feed or to play with them; they are
scrupulously fed by the overseer or master, and thus constitute
the animal police of the plantation. In no wise can
they be brought to attack a white man, and it would be
difficult for such to provoke them to an expression of rage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
or anger, while their early and systematic training makes
them feel a natural enmity to the blacks, which is of course
most heartily reciprocated.</p>

<p>Cuba has been called the hot-bed of slavery; and it is
in a certain sense true. The largest plantations own from
three to five hundred negroes, which establishments require
immense investments of capital successfully to manage. A
slave, when first landed, is worth, if sound, from four to
five hundred dollars, and more as he becomes acclimated
and instructed, their dull natures requiring a vast deal of
watchful training before they can be brought to any positive
usefulness, in doing which the overseers have found kindness
go a vast deal farther than roughness. Trifling rewards,
repaying the first efforts at breaking in of the newly
imported negro, establishes a good understanding at once,
and thus they soon grow very tractable, though they do not
for a long time understand a single word of Spanish that
is addressed to them.</p>

<p>These negroes are from various African tribes, and their
characteristics are visibly marked, so that their nationality
is at once discernible, even to a casual observer. Thus the
Congos are small in stature, but agile and good laborers;
the Fantee are a larger race, revengeful, and apt to prove
uneasy; those from the Gold Coast are still more powerful,
and command higher prices, and when well treated make
excellent domestic servants. The Ebros are less black than
the others, being almost mulatto. There is a tribe known<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
as the Ashantees, very rare in Cuba, as they are powerful
at home, and consequently are rarely conquered in battle,
or taken prisoners by the shore tribes in Africa, who sell
them to the slave factories on the coast. They are prized,
like those from the Gold Coast, for their strength. Another
tribe, known as the Carrobalees, are highly esteemed by the
planters, but yet they are avoided when first imported, from
the fact that they have a belief and hope, very powerful
among them, that after death they will return to their native
land, and therefore, actuated by a love of home, these poor
exiles are prone to suicide. This superstition is also believed
in by some other tribes; and when a death thus
occurs, the planter, as an example to the rest, and to prevent
a like occurrence among them, burns the body, and scatters
the ashes to the wind!</p>

<p>The tattooed faces, bodies and limbs, of the larger portion
of the slaves, especially those found inland upon the plantations,
indicate their African birth; those born upon the
island seldom mark themselves thus, and being more intelligent
than their parents, from mingling with civilization,
are chosen generally for city labor, becoming postilions,
house-servants, draymen, laborers upon the wharves, and the
like, presenting physical developments that a white man
cannot but envy on beholding, and showing that for some
philosophical reason the race thus transplanted improves
physically, at least. They are remarkably healthy; indeed,
all classes of slaves are so, except when an epidemic breaks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
out among them, and then it rages more fearfully far than
with the whites. Thus the cholera and small-pox always
sweep them off by hundreds when these diseases get fairly
introduced among them. If a negro is sick he requires just
twice as much medicine as a white man to affect him, but
for what reason is a mystery in the practice of the healing
art. The prevailing illness with them is bowel complaints,
to which they are always more or less addicted, and their
food is therefore regulated to obviate this trouble as far as
possible, but they always eat freely of the fruits about them,
so ripe and inviting, and so plentiful, too, that half the crop
and more, usually rots upon the ground ungathered. The
swine are frequently let loose to help clear the ground of
its overburdened and ripened fruits.</p>

<p>The slaves upon the plantations in all outward circumstances
seem quite thoughtless and happy; the slave code of
the island, which regulates their government, is never widely
departed from. The owners are obliged to instruct them
all in the Catholic faith, and they are each baptized as soon
as they can understand the signification of the ceremony.
The law also provides that the master shall give a certain
quantity and variety of food to his slaves; but on this score
slaves rarely if ever have cause of complaint, as it is plainly
for the planter's interest to keep them in good condition.
There is one redeeming feature in Spanish slavery, as contrasted
with that of our southern country, and that is, that
the laws favor emancipation. If a slave by his industry is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
able to accumulate money enough to pay his <i>first cost</i> to
his master, however unwilling the planter may be to part
with him, the law guarantees him his freedom. This the
industrious slave can accomplish at farthest in seven years,
with the liberty and convenience which all are allowed.
Each one, for instance, is permitted to keep a pig, and to
cultivate a small piece of land for his own purposes, by
raising corn; the land yielding two crops to the year, they
can render a pig fat enough, and the drovers pay fifty dollars
apiece to the slaves for good ones. This is a <i>redeeming</i>
feature, but it is a bitter pill at best.</p>

<p>There are doubtless instances of cruelty towards the
slaves, but the writer is forced to acknowledge that he
never witnessed a single evidence of this during his stay in
the island,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and, while he would be the last person to defend
slavery as an institution, yet he is satisfied that the practical
evils of its operation are vastly overrated by ignorant
persons. It is so obviously for the planter's interest to treat
his slaves kindly, and to have due consideration for their
health and comfort&mdash;that he must be a very short-sighted
being not to realize this. What man would under-feed,
ill-treat, or poorly care for a horse that he expected to
serve him, in return, promptly and well? We have only
to consider the subject in this light for a moment, to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
how impossible it is that a system of despotism, severity
and cruelty, would be exercised by a Cuban master towards
his slaves. Let no ingenious person distort these remarks
into a pro-slavery argument. God forbid!</p>

<p>Like Liverpool and Boston, in their early days, Havana
has drawn an immense wealth from the slave-trade; it has
been the great commercial item in the business for the capital
year after year, and the fitting out of ventures, the manning
of vessels, and other branches of trade connected therewith,
have been the sources of uncounted profit to those
concerned. The vessels employed in this business were
built with an eye to the utmost speed. Even before the
notion of clipper ships was conceived, these crafts were built
on the clipper model, more generally known as Baltimore
clippers. Over these sharp hulls was spread a quantity of
canvas that might have served as an outfit for a seventy-four.
The consummate art displayed in their construction
was really curious, and they were utterly unfit for any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
legitimate commerce. Nor are these vessels by any means
yet extinct. They hover about the island here and there
at this very hour; now lying securely in some sheltered
bay on the south side, and now seeking a rendezvous at the
neighboring Isle of Pines. The trade still employs many
crafts. They mount guns, have a magazine in accordance
with their tonnage, with false decks that can be shipped and
unshipped at will.</p>

<p>It is well known that the Americans can produce the
fastest vessels in the world; and speed is the grand desideratum
with the slaver, consequently Americans are employed
to build the fleet crafts that sail for the coast of
Africa. The American builder must of course know the
purpose for which he constructs these clippers; and, indeed,
the writer is satisfied, from personal observation, that these
vessels are built on speculation, and sent to Cuba to be sold
to the highest bidder. Of course, being in a measure contraband,
they bring large prices, and the temptation is
strong to construct them, rather than to engage in the more
regular models. This reference to the subject as connected
with the commerce of the island, leads us to look back to
the history of the pernicious traffic in human beings, from
its earliest commencement in Cuba, and to trace its beginning,
progress and main features.</p>

<p>It has been generally supposed that Las Casas first suggested
the plan of substituting African slave labor for that
of the Indians in Cuba, he having noticed that the natives,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
entirely unused to labor, sunk under the hard tasks imposed
upon them, while the robuster negroes thrived
under the same circumstances. But negro slavery did not
originate with Las Casas. Spain had been engaged in the
slave trade for years, and long prior to the discovery of
America by Columbus; and Zu&ntilde;iga tells us that they
abounded in Seville. Consequently Spanish emigrants
from the old world brought their slaves with them to Cuba,
and the transportation of negro slaves, born in slavery
among Christians, was sanctioned expressly by royal ordinances.
Ferdinand sent over fifty slaves to labor in the
royal mines: Las Casas pleaded for the further employment
of negroes, and consequent extension of the slave
trade. "But covetousness," says Bancroft, "and not a
mistaken benevolence, established the slave trade, which
had nearly received its development before the charity of
Las Casas was heard in defence of the Indians. Reason,
policy and religion alike condemned the traffic."</p>

<p>Cardinal Ximenes, the grand inquisitor of Spain, protested
against the introduction of negroes in Hispaniola,
foreseeing the dangers incident to their increase; and three
centuries later the successful revolt of the slaves of Hayti,
the first place in America which received African slaves,
justified his intelligent predictions and forebodings. England
embarked largely in the slave trade, and Queen Elizabeth
shared in the guilty profits of the traffic. In the year
1713, when, after a period of rest, the slave trade was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
resumed, the English purchased of Spain a monopoly of the
trade with the Spanish colonies, and she carried it on with
great vigor and pecuniary success, until she had completely
stocked these islands with blacks. In the year 1763 their
number was estimated at sixty thousand. This fact will
enable us to appreciate as it deserves the extreme modesty
of the British government in fomenting abolition schemes in
the island of Cuba, after contributing so largely to the creation
of an evil which appears almost irremediable. We
say a realizing sense of the circumstances of the case will
enable us rightly to appreciate the character of the British
government's philanthropy. We applaud England for her
efforts at the suppression of the slave trade,&mdash;a traffic
which all the powers of Christendom, Spain excepted, have
united to crush,&mdash;but we cannot patiently contemplate her
efforts to interfere with the internal economy of other countries,
when she herself, as in the case of the Spanish colonies
and of the United States, has so weighty a share of
responsibility in the condition of things as they now exist;
to say nothing of the social condition of her own subjects,
which so imperatively demands that her charity should
begin at home.</p>

<p>We have said that Spain alone, of the great powers, has
not done her part in the suppression of the slave trade.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
She is solemnly pledged by treaty stipulations, to make
unceasing war against it, and yet she tacitly connives at its
continuance, and all the world knows that slaves are monthly,
almost weekly, landed in Cuba. Notorious is it that the
captains-general have regularly pocketed a fee of one doubloon
or more for every slave landed, and that this has
been a prolific source of wealth to them. The exceptions to
this have been few, and the evidences are indisputable.
Within a league of the capital are several large barracoons,
as they are called, where the newly-imported slaves are
kept, and offered for sale in numbers. The very fact that
these establishments exist so near to Havana, is a circumstance
from which each one may draw his own inference.
No one can travel in Cuba without meeting on the various
plantations groups of the newly-imported Africans. Valdez,
who strenuously enforced the treaty obligations relative
to the trade, without regard to private interest, was traduced
by the Spaniards, and by their management fell into
disfavor with his government at home. O'Donnell deluged
the island with slaves during his administration, and filled
his coffers with the fees accruing therefrom. Since his time
the business has gone on,&mdash;to be sure less openly, and
under necessary restrictions, but nevertheless with great
pecuniary profit.</p>

<p>At the same time the Spanish authorities have, while
thus increasing the numbers of savage Africans reduced to
a state of slavery, constantly endeavored to weaken the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
bonds of attachment between master and slave, and to ferment
the unnatural hatred of races with the fearful design
of preparing another St. Domingo for the Cubans, should
they dare to strike a strenuous blow for freedom.</p>

<p>We have thus seen that the Spanish crown is directly
responsible for the introduction of slavery into Cuba, and
that crown officers, invested with more than vice-regal
authority, have sanctioned, up to this day, the accumulation
and the aggravation of the evil. It is now clearly
evident that the slave-trade will continue so long as the
island of Cuba remains under the Spanish flag. The British
government have remonstrated again and again with
Spain, against this long-continued infraction of treaties;
but the dogged obstinacy of the Spanish character has been
proof against remonstrance and menace. She merits the
loss of Cuba for her persistent treachery and perfidy, leaving
out of the account a long list of foul wrongs practised
upon the colony, the enormous burthen of taxes placed upon
it, and the unequalled rigor of its rule. The time has
come when the progress of civilization demands that the
island shall pass into the hands of some power possessed of
the ability and the will to crush out this remnant of barbarism.
That power is clearly designated by the hand of
Providence. No European nation can dream of obtaining
Cuba; no administration in this country could stand up for
one moment against the overwhelming indignation of the
people, should it be weak enough to acquiesce in the trans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>fer
of Cuba to any European power. The island must be
Spanish or American. Had it been the property of a first-rate
power, of any other European sovereignty but Spain,
it would long since have been a cause of war. It is only
the imbecile weakness of Spain that has thus far protected
her against the consequences of a continuous course of perfidy,
tyranny and outrage. But the impunity of the feeble
and the forbearance of the strong have their limits; and
nations, like individuals, are amenable to the laws of retributive
justice.</p>

<p>The present condition of Spain is a striking illustration
of the mutability of fortune, from which states, no more
than individuals, are exempted. We read of such changes
in the destinies of ancient empires,&mdash;the decadence of
Egypt, the fall of Assyria, and Babylon, and Byzantium,
and Rome; but their glory and fall were both so far distant
in the recess of time, that their history seems, to all
of us who have not travelled and inspected the monuments
which attest the truth of these events, a sort of romance:
whereas, in the case of Spain, we realize its greatness, and
behold its fall! One reason why we feel so deep an interest
in the fate of the Castilian power, is that the history of
Spain is so closely interwoven with that of our own
country,&mdash;discovered
and colonized as it was under the auspices of
the Spanish government. We owe our very existence to
Spain, and from the close of the fifteenth century our histories
have run on in parallel lines. But while America<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
has gone on increasing in the scale of destiny, in grandeur,
power and wealth, poor Spain has sunk in the scale of destiny,
with a rapidity of decadence no less astonishing than
the speed of our own progress. The discovery of America,
as before alluded to, seemed to open to Spain a boundless
source of wealth and splendid power; triumphs awaited her
arms in both North and South America. Cortes in Mexico
and Pizarro in Peru added vast territory and millions of
treasure to the national wealth. But we have seen how
sure is retribution. One by one those ill-gotten possessions
have escaped the grasp of the mother country; and now, in
her old age, poor, and enfeebled, and worn out, she clings,
with the death-gripe of a plundered and expiring miser, to
her last earthly possession in the New World.</p>

<p>Moved in some degree by the same spirit that actuates
the home government, the Cubans have heretofore viewed
anything that looked like an attempt at improvement with
a suspicious eye; they have learned to fear innovation; but
this trait is yielding, as seen in the introduction of railroads,
telegraphs, and even the lighting of the city of Havana
by gas,&mdash;all done by Americans, who had first to
contend with great opposition, and to run imminent risks and
lavish energy and money; but when these things are once
in the course of successful experiment, none are more ready
than the Cubans to approve. This same characteristic,
a clinging to the past and a fear of advancement, seems to
have imparted itself to the very scenery of the island, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
everything here appears to be of centuries in age, reminding
one of the idea he has formed of the hallowed East. The
style of the buildings is not dissimilar to that which is
found throughout the Orient, and the trees and vegetable
products increase the resemblance. Particularly in approaching
Havana from the interior, the view of the city
resembles almost precisely the Scriptural picture of Jerusalem.
The tall, majestic palms, with their tufted tops, the
graceful cocoanut tree, and many other peculiarities, give
to the scenery of Cuba an Eastern aspect, very impressive
to the stranger. It is impossible to describe to one who
has not visited the tropics, the bright vividness with which
each object, artificial or natural, house or tree, stands out
in the clear liquid light, where there is no haze nor smoke
to interrupt the view. Indeed, it is impossible to express
fully how <i>everything</i> differs in Cuba from our own country,
so near at hand. The language, the people, the climate,
the manners and customs, the architecture, the foliage,
the flowers and general products, all and each afford
broad contrasts to what the American has ever seen at
home. But a long cannon-shot, as it were, off our southern
coast, yet once upon its soil, the visitor seems to have been
transported into another quarter of the globe, the first impression
being, as we have said, decidedly of an Oriental
character. But little effort of the imagination would be
required to believe oneself in distant Syria, or some remote
part of Asia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>But let us recur for one moment to the subject of the
slaves from which we have unwittingly digressed. On the
plantations the slaves have some rude musical instruments,
which they manufacture themselves, and which emit a dull
monotonous sound, to the cadence of which they sit by moonlight
and sing or chant, for hours together. One of these
instruments is a rude drum to the beating of which they
perform grotesque dances, with unwearying feet, really surprising
the looker-on by their power of endurance in sustaining
themselves in vigorous dancing. Generally, or as is
often the case, a part of Saturday of each week is granted
to the slaves, when they may frequently be seen engaged at
ball, playing a curious game after their own fashion. This
time of holiday many prefer to pass in working upon their
own allotted piece of ground and in raising favorite vegetables
and fruits, or corn for the fattening of the pig hard by, and
for which the drovers, who regularly visit the plantations for
the purpose, will pay them in good golden doubloons. It is
thought that the city slave has a less arduous task than
those in the country, for he is little exposed to the sun, and
is allowed many privileges, such for instance as attending
church, and in this the negroes seem to take particular
delight, especially if well dressed. A few gaudy ribbons,
and nice glass beads of high color are vastly prized by both
sexes of the slaves in town and country. In the cities some
mistresses take pleasure in decking out their immediate
male and female attendants in fine style with gold ornaments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
in profusion. There was one beautiful sight the writer particularly
noticed in the church of Santa Clara, viz: that
before the altar all distinction was dropped, and the negro
knelt beside the Don.</p>

<p>The virgin soil of Cuba is so rich that a touch of the
hoe prepares it for the plant, or, as Douglass Jerrold says
of Australia, "just tickle her with a hoe and she laughs
with a harvest." So fertile a soil is not known to exist in
any other portion of the globe. It sometimes produces three
crops to the year, and in ordinary seasons two may be relied
upon,&mdash;the consequence is that the Monteros have little more
to do than merely to gather the produce they daily carry
to market, and which also forms so large a portion of their
own healthful and palatable food. The profusion of its flora
and the variety of its forests are unsurpassed, while the multitude
of its climbing shrubs gives a luxuriant richness to
its scenery, which contributes to make it one of the most fascinating
countries in the world. Nowhere are the necessities
of life so easily supplied, or man so delicately nurtured.</p>

<p>The richest soil of the island is the black, which is best
adapted to the purpose of the sugar-planter, and for this
purpose it is usually chosen. So productive is this description
of land that the extensive sugar plantations, once fairly
started, will run for years, without the soil being even
turned, new cane starting up from the old roots, year after
year, with abundant crops. This is a singular fact to us who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
are accustomed to see so much of artificial means expended
upon the soil to enable it to bear even an ordinary crop to
the husbandman. The red soil is less rich, and is better
adapted to the planting of coffee, being generally preferred
for this purpose, while the mulatto-colored earth is considered
inferior, but still is very productive and is improved by
the Monteros for planting tobacco, being first prepared with
a mixture of the other two descriptions of soil which together
form the richest compost, next to guano, known in agriculture.</p>

<p>Coal is fortunately found on the island, of a bituminous
nature; had this not been the case, the numerous steam
engines which are now at work on the plantations would
have soon consumed every vestige of wood on the island,
though by proper economy the planter can save much by
burning the refuse cane. The soil is also rich in mineral
wealth, particularly in copper, iron and loadstone. Gold
and silver mines have been opened, and in former times were
worked extensively, but are now entirely abandoned. The
copper mines near Sagua la Grande in 1841 yielded about
four millions of dollars, but the exactions of the government
were such that they greatly reduced the yield of the
ore. An export duty of five per cent. was at first imposed
upon the article: finally the exportation was prohibited altogether,
unless shipped to old Spain, with a view of compelling
the owners to smelt it in that country. These arbitrary
measures soon reduced the profit of the business, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
the working of the mines from producing in 1841 four millions,
to about two by 1845, and finally they were abandoned.</p>

<p>And now is it to be wondered at that the Creoles should
groan under the load of oppressions forced upon them as
depicted in the foregoing pages? No! On the contrary
we feel that they are too forbearing, and look to the enervating
influence of their clime as an excuse for their supineness
under such gross wrongs. Their lovely climate and
beautiful land are made gloomy by the persecutions of their
oppressors; their exuberant soil groans with the burthens
that are heaped upon it. They are not safe from prying
inquiry at bed or board, and their every action is observed,
their slightest words noted. They can sing no song not in
praise of royalty, and even to hum an air wedded to republican
verse is to provoke suspicion and perhaps arrest. The
press is muzzled by the iron hand of power, and speaks only
in adulation of a distant queen and a corrupt court. Foreign
soldiers fatten upon the people, eating out their substance,
and every village near the coast of the island is a garrison,
every interior town is environed with bayonets!</p>

<p>A vast deal has been said about the impregnable harbor
of Havana, the "Gibraltar of America" being its common
designation, but modern military science acknowledges no
place to be impregnable. A thousand chances might happen
which would give the place to an invading force; besides
which it has been already twice taken; and though it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
may be said that on these occasions it was not nearly so
well garrisoned as now, neither so well armed or manned,
the reply is also ready that it has never been besieged by
such a force as could now be brought against it, to say nothing
of the vast advantage afforded by the modern facilities
for destruction.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Were not the <i>inaccessible</i> heights of
Abraham scaled in a night? and how easily the impregnable
fortress of San Juan de Ulloa fell! Havana could
be attacked from the land side and easily taken by a resolute
enemy. With the exception of this one fortress, the
Moro, and the fort in its rear, the Cabensas, the island is
very poorly defended, and is accessible to an invading force
in almost any direction, either on the east, west, or south
coast. Matanzas, but sixty miles from Havana, could be
taken by a small force from the land side, and serve as a
depot from whence to operate, should a systematic effort be
organized. Cuba's boasted strength is chimerical.</p>

<p>Steam and the telegraph are revolutionizing all business
relations and the course of trade. A line of steamers, one
of the best in the world, runs between New York and Havana,
also New Orleans and Havana. By this means all
important intelligence reaches Cuba in advance of any other
source, and through this country. By the telegraph, Havana
is brought within three days' communication with New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
York and Boston. All important advices must continue to
reach the island through the United States, and the people
must still look to this country for political and commercial
information, and to the movement of our markets for the
regulation of their own trade and commerce. New Orleans
has become the great centre to which their interests will
naturally tend; and thus we see another strong tie of common
interest established between the island of Cuba and
the United States.</p>

<p>Naturally belonging to this country by every rule that
can be applied, the writer believes that Cuba will ere long
be politically ours. As the wise and good rejoice in the
extension of civilization, refinement, the power of religion
and high-toned morality, they will look forward hopefully
to such an event. Once a part of this great confederacy, Cuba
would immediately catch the national spirit and genius of
our institutions, and the old Castilian state of dormancy
would give way to Yankee enterprise, her length and breadth
would be made to smile like a New England landscape
Her sons and daughters would be fully awakened to a true
sense of their own responsibility, intelligence would be sown
broadcast, and the wealth of wisdom would shine among the
cottages of the poor.</p>

<p>In the place of the rolling drum and piercing fife, would
be heard the clink of the hammer and the merry laugh of
untrammelled spirits. The bayonets that bristle now on
every hill-side would give place to waving corn, and bright<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
fields of grain. The honest Montero would lay aside his
Toledo blade and pistol holsters, and the citizen who went
abroad after sunset would go unarmed. Modern churches,
dedicated to pure Christianity, would raise their lofty spires
and point towards heaven beside those ancient and time-eaten
cathedrals. The barrack rooms and guard stations,
in every street, town or village, would be transformed into
school-houses, and the trade winds of the tropics would
sweep over a new Republic!</p>

<p><i>Area of Cuba.</i>&mdash;Humboldt states the area of the island
to be 43,380 geographical square miles. Mr. Turnbull
puts it at 31,468, and, adding the areas of its dependencies,
namely, the Isle of Pines, Turignano, Romano, Guajaba,
Coco, Cruz, Paredon Grande, Barril, De Puerto, Eusenachos,
Frances, Largo, and other smaller islands, makes
the total 32,807 square miles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>In Paris, the ratio is 54.5 per cent. males, to 45.5 females;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
in England, 50.3 per cent. males, and 49.7 per cent.
females, and in the United States, 51 per cent. males, and
49 per cent. females.</p>

<p>The ratio of legitimate to illegitimate births, deduced
from the observations of five years, is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:20em;">
2.1136 to 1 among the whites;<br />
0.5058 to 1 among the colored;<br />
1.0216 to 1 in the total.<br />
</p>

<p>That is to say, establishing the comparison per centum,
as in the proportion of the sexes, we have:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="whites">
<tr><td align='left'>Whites,</td><td align='left'>67.8 per cent. legitimate, and 32.2 per cent. illegitimate.</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>No capital or people of Europe, Stockholm alone excepted,
offers so startling a result, nearly one half the number
of births being illegitimate.</p>

<p>Taking the average from the statements of births for five
years, we find that in every 100 legitimate whites there are
51.1 males, and 48.9 females; and in an equal number of
illegitimate, 49 males, and 51 females. Among people of
color, in 100 legitimate births, 50.6 males, and 49.4 females;
and in the illegitimate, 47.2 males, and 52.8 females.
And finally, that, comparing the totals, we obtain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
in the legitimate, 51.6 males, and 48.4 females; and in the
illegitimate, 47.1 males, and 52.9 females. Consequently
these observations show that in Cuba, in the illegitimate
births, the number of males is much less than that of
females, and the contrary in the legitimate births.</p>

<h5><br />COMMERCE AND COMMERCIAL REGULATIONS.</h5>

<p><i>Import duties.</i>&mdash;The rate of duty charged on the importation
of foreign produce and manufactures in foreign
bottoms is 24&frac12; and 30&frac14; on the tariff valuation of each article,
while the same articles in Spanish bottoms, from a foreign
port, pay 17&frac12; and 21&frac14; per cent.</p>

<p><i>Export duties.</i>&mdash;Foreign flag for any port, 6&frac14; per cent.
on tariff valuation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>Spanish flag for a foreign port, 4&frac12; per cent. on tariff
valuation.</p>

<p>Spanish flag for Spanish port, 2&frac14; per cent. on tariff
valuation; except leaf tobacco, which pays 12&frac12;, 6&frac14; and 2&frac14;
per cent., according to the flag and destination.</p>

<p>An additional per centage, under various pretexts, is also
levied on the total amount of all duties.</p>

<p>Foreign flour is subject to a duty that is nearly prohibitory.</p>

<p>Gold and silver are free of import duty, but pay, the
former 1&frac14; and the latter 2&frac14; per cent., export.</p>

<p>Every master of a vessel, on entering port, is obliged to
present two manifests of his cargo and stores,&mdash;one to the
boarding officers, and the other at the time of making entry
and taking both the oaths, twenty-four hours after his arrival,
with permission of making any necessary corrections
within the twelve working hours; and every consignee is
required to deliver a detailed invoice of each cargo to his,
her or their consignment, within forty-eight hours after the
vessel has entered port, and heavy penalties are incurred
from mere omission or inaccuracy.</p>

<p>The tonnage duty on foreign vessels is 12 rials, or $1.50,
per register ton.</p>

<p>On vessels arriving and departing in ballast or putting
in in distress no duty is levied.</p>

<p>Besides the tonnage duty, every foreign square-rigged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
vessel entering and loading incurs about $85 expenses,
besides $5.50 for each day occupied in discharging.
Foreign fore-and-aft vessels pay about $15 less port
charges.</p>

<p>The tonnage duties and port charges are very high.
Foreign vessels pay $8.50 per ton. In the port of Havana
an additional duty of 21-7/8 cents per ton is levied on
all vessels for the support of the dredging machine.</p>

<p>The wharf charges on foreign vessels are $1.50 for each
100 tons register.</p>

<p>The light-house duties, officers' fees, etc., vary at the different
ports of the island, but are exorbitantly high in all.
At Baracoa, for instance, the following is the tariff of
exactions:</p>

<p><i>Universities, Schools, etc.</i>&mdash;Besides the Royal University
at Havana, there are several other learned institutes,
such as the Royal Seminary of San Carlos y San Ambrosio,
founded in 1773; a seminary for girls, founded in
1691; a free school for sculpture and painting, which dates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
from 1818; a free mercantile school, and some private
seminaries, to which we have before referred. The Royal
Economical Society of Havana, formerly called the Patriotic
Society, was established in 1793, and is divided into
three principal sections, on education, agriculture, commerce
and popular industry; a department of history has
been added. Several eminent and talented men have given
eclat to this institution.</p>

<p>The Medical School was organized in 1842.</p>

<p>The means of general education are very narrow and
inadequate. No report on the state of education in the
island has been published since 1836. At that time, there
were two hundred and ten schools for white, and thirty-one
for colored children. In 1842, the public funds for educational
purposes were reduced from thirty-two thousand to
eight thousand dollars. Nueva Filipina, in a rich tobacco-growing
district, with a population of thirty thousand souls,
had but one school for forty pupils, a few years since.</p>

<p><i>Charitable Institutions, Hospitals, etc.</i>&mdash;There are
several charitable institutions in Havana, with ample funds
and well managed. Such are the Casa Real de Beneficencia,
the Hospital of San Lazaro and the Foundling Hospital,&mdash;Casa
Real de Maternidad. In other parts of the
island, there are eighteen hospitals, located in its chief
towns.</p>

<p><i>Railroads.</i>&mdash;The first railroad built in Cuba was that
from Havana to Guines, forty-five miles in length, com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>pleted
and opened in 1839. In 1848, there were two hundred
and eighty-five miles of railroads on the island, and
the capital invested in them has been computed at between
five and six millions of dollars.</p>

<p><i>Climate.</i>&mdash;The diversity of surface gives rise to considerable
variation in temperature. On the highest mountain
ridges, at four thousand feet above the level of the sea,
ice is sometimes formed in mid winter, but snow is unknown.</p>

<p>The mean temperature of the hottest months (July and
August) is about 83&deg; Fahrenheit. The coldest months are
January and December.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>It is with infinite reluctance that the temporary sojourner
in Cuba leaves her delicious shores, and takes his farewell
look at their enchanting features. A brief residence in the
island passes like a midsummer night's dream, and it
requires a strenuous effort of the mind to arrive at the conviction
that the memories one brings away with him are not
delusive sports of the imagination. Smiling skies and smiling
waters, groves of palm and orange, the bloom of the
heliotrope, the jessamine, and the rose, flights of strange
and gaudy birds, tropic nights at once luxurious and calm,
clouds of fire-flies floating like unsphered stars on the night
breeze, graceful figures of dark-eyed se&ntilde;oritas in diaphanous
drapery, picturesque groups of Monteros, relieved by the
dusky faces and stalwart forms of the sons of Africa, undu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>lating
volantes, military pageants, ecclesiastical processions,
frowning fortresses, grim batteries, white sails, fountains
raining silver,&mdash;all these images mingle together in brilliant
and kaleidoscopic combinations, changing and varying as
the mind's eye seeks to fix their features. Long after his
departure from the enchanting island the traveller beholds
these visions in the still watches of the night, and again he
listens to the dash of the sea-green waves at the foot of the
Moro and the Punta, the roll of the drum and the crash of
arms upon the ramparts, and the thrilling strains of music
from the military band in the Plaza de Armas. The vexations
incident to all travel, and meted out in no stinted
measure to the visitor at Cuba, are amply repaid by the
spectacles it presents.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 13em;">
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"&mdash;&mdash;It is a goodly sight to see</span><br />
What Heaven hath done for this delicious land!<br />
What fruits of fragrance blush on every tree!<br />
What goodly prospects o'er the hills expand!"<br />
</p>

<p>If it were possible to contemplate only the beauties that
nature has so prodigally lavished on this Eden of the Gulf,
shutting out all that man has done and is still doing to mar
the blessings of Heaven, then a visit to or residence in Cuba
would present a succession of unalloyed pleasures equal to a
poet's dream. But it is impossible, even if it would be desirable,
to exclude the dark side of the picture. The American
traveller, particularly, keenly alive to the social and political
aspects of life, appreciates in full force the evils that chal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>lenge
his observation at every step, and in every view which
he may take. If he contrast the natural scenery with the familiar
pictures of home, he cannot help also contrasting the
political condition of the people with that of his own country.
The existence, almost under the shadow of the flag of the
freest institutions the earth ever knew, of a government as
purely despotic as that of the autocrat of all the Russias,
is a monstrous fact that startles the most indifferent observer.
It must be seen to be realized. To go hence to
Cuba is not merely passing over a few degrees of latitude in
a few days' sail,&mdash;it is a step from the nineteenth century
back into the dark ages. In the clime of sun and endless
summer, we are in the land of starless political darkness.
Lying under the lee of a land where every man is a sovereign,
is a realm where the lives, liberties, and fortunes of
all are held at the tenure of the will of a single individual,
and whence not a single murmur of complaint can reach the
ear of the nominal ruler more than a thousand leagues away
in another hemisphere. In close proximity to a country
where the taxes, self-imposed, are so light as to be almost
unfelt, is one where each free family pays nearly four hundred
dollars per annum for the support of a system of bigoted
tyranny, yielding in the aggregate an annual revenue
of twenty-five millions of dollars for which they receive no
equivalent,&mdash;no representation, no utterance, for pen and
tongue are alike proscribed,&mdash;no honor, no office, no emolument;
while their industry is crippled, their intercourse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
with other nations hampered in every way, their bread literally
snatched from their lips, the freedom of education
denied, and every generous, liberal aspiration of the human
soul stifled in its birth. And this in the nineteenth century,
and in North America.</p>

<p>Such are the contrasts, broad and striking, and such the
reflections forced upon the mind of the citizen of the United
States in Cuba. Do they never occur to the minds of the
Creoles? We are told that they are willing slaves. Spain
tells us so, and she extols to the world with complacent
mendacity the loyalty of her "<i>siempre fielissima isla de
Cuba</i>." But why does she have a soldier under arms for
every four white adults? We were about to say, white
male citizens, but there are no citizens in Cuba. A proportionate
military force in this country would give us a
standing army of more than a million bayonets, with an
annual expenditure, reckoning each soldier to cost only two
hundred dollars per annum, of more than two hundred millions
of dollars. And this is the peace establishment of
Spain in Cuba&mdash;for England and France and the United
States are all her allies, and she has no longer to fear the
roving buccaneers of the Gulf who once made her tremble
in her island fastness. For whom then is this enormous
warlike preparation? Certainly for no external enemy,&mdash;there
is none. The question answers itself,&mdash;it is for her
very loyal subjects, the people of Cuba, that the queen of
Spain makes all this warlike show.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>It is impossible to conceive of any degree of loyalty that
would be proof against the unparalleled burthens and atrocious
system by which the mother country has ever loaded
and weighed down her western colonists. They must be
either more or less than men if they still cherish attachment
to a foreign throne under such circumstances. But the
fact simply is, the Creoles of Cuba are neither angels nor
brutes; they are, it is true, a long-suffering and somewhat indolent
people, lacking in a great degree the stern qualities of
the Anglo-Saxon and the Anglo-Norman races, but nevertheless
intelligent, if wanting culture, and not without those
noble aspirations for independence and freedom, destitute of
which they would cease to be men, justly forfeiting all
claim to our sympathy and consideration. During the brief
intervals in which a liberal spirit was manifested towards
the colony by the home government, the Cubans gave proof
of talent and energy, which, had they been permitted to
attain their full development, would have given them a
highly honorable name and distinguished character. When
the field for genius was comparatively clear, Cuba produced
more than one statesman and man of science, who would
have done honor to a more favored land.</p>

<p>But these cheering rays of light were soon extinguished,
and the fluctuating policy of Spain settled down into the
rayless and brutal despotism which has become its normal
condition, and a double darkness closed upon the political
and intellectual prospects of Cuba. But the people are not,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
and have not been the supine and idle victims of tyranny
which Spain depicts them. The reader, who has indulgently
followed us thus far, will remember the several times
they have attempted, manacled as they are, to free their
limbs from the chains that bind them. It is insulting and
idle to say that they might have been free if they had earnestly
desired and made the effort for freedom. Who can say
what would have been the result of our own struggle for
independence, if Great Britain, at the outset, had been as
well prepared for resistance as Spain has always been in
Cuba? Who can say how long and painful would have
been the struggle, if one of the most powerful military
nations of Europe had not listened to our despairing appeal,
and thrown the weight of her gold and her arms into the
scale against our great enemy? When we see how&mdash;as
we do clearly&mdash;in a single night the well-contrived schemes
of an adroit and unprincipled knave enslaved a brilliant and
warlike people, like the French, who had more than once
tasted the fruits of republican glory and liberty, who had
borne their free flag in triumph over more than half of
Europe, we can understand why the Cubans, overawed from
the very outset, by the presence of a force vastly greater in
proportion than that which enslaved France, have been
unable to achieve their deliverance. Nay, more&mdash;when we
consider the system pursued by the government of the
island, the impossibility of forming assemblages, and of concerting
action, the presence of troops and spies everywhere,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
the compulsory silence of the press&mdash;the violation of the
sanctity of correspondence, the presence of a slave population,
we can only wonder that any effort has been made,
any step taken in that fatal pathway of revolution which
leads infallibly to the <i>garrote</i>.</p>

<p>If Cuba lies at present under the armed heel of despotism
we may be sure that the anguish of her sons is keenly
aggravated by their perfect understanding of our own liberal
institutions, and an earnest, if fruitless desire to participate
in their enjoyment. It is beyond the power of the
Spanish government to keep the people of the island in a
state of complete darkness, as it seems to desire to do.
The young men of Cuba educated at our colleges and
schools, the visitors from the United States, and American
merchants established on the island, are all so many apostles
of republicanism, and propagandists of treason and rebellion.
Nor can the captains-general with all their vigilance,
exclude what they are pleased to call incendiary
newspapers and documents from pretty extensive circulation
among the "ever faithful." That liberal ideas and hatred
of Spanish despotism are widely entertained among the
Cubans is a fact no one who has passed a brief period among
them can truthfully deny. The writer of these pages avers,
from his personal knowledge, that they await only the
means and the opportunity to rise in rebellion against Spain.
We are too far distant to see more than the light smoke,
but those who have trodden the soil of Cuba have sounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
the depths of the volcano. The history of the unfortunate
Lopez expedition proves nothing contrary to this. The
force under Lopez afforded too weak a nucleus, was too
hastily thrown upon the island, too ill prepared, and too
untimely attacked, to enable the native patriots to rally
round its standard, and thus to second the efforts of the
invaders. With no ammunition nor arms to spare, recruits
would have only added to the embarrassment of the adventurers.
Yet had Lopez been joined by the brave but unfortunate
Crittenden, with what arms and ammunition he possessed,
had he gained some fastness where he could have
been disciplining his command, until further aid arrived, the
adventure might have had a very different termination from
what we have recorded in an early chapter of this book.</p>

<p>Disastrous as was the result of the Lopez expedition, it
nevertheless proved two important facts: first, the bravery of
the Cubans, a small company of whom drove the enemy at
the point of the bayonet; and, secondly, the inefficiency of
Spanish troops when opposed by resolute men. If a large
force of picked Spanish troops were decimated and routed
in two actions, by a handful of ill-armed and undisciplined
men, taken by surprise, we are justified in believing that if
an effective force of ten thousand men, comprising the several
arms, of cavalry, artillery, and infantry, had been
thrown into the island, they would have carried all before
them. With such a body of men to rally upon, the Cubans
would have risen in the departments of the island, and her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
best transatlantic jewel would have been torn from the diadem
of Spain.</p>

<p>That the Spanish government lives in constant dread of a
renewal of the efforts on the part of Americans and exiled
Cubans to aid the disaffected people of the island in throwing
off its odious yoke, is a notorious fact, and there are
evidences in the conduct of its officials towards those of this
government that it regards the latter as secretly favoring
such illegal action. Yet the steps taken by our government to
crush any such attempts have been decided enough to satisfy
any but a jealous and unreasonable power. President Fillmore,
in his memorable proclamation, said, "Such expeditions
can only be regarded as adventures for plunder and
robbery," and declaring Americans who engaged in them
outlaws, informed them that "they would forfeit their claim
to the protection of this government, or any interference in
their behalf, no matter to what extremity they might be
reduced in consequence of their illegal conduct." In accordance
with this declaration, the brave Crittenden and his
men were allowed to be shot at Atares, though they were
not taken with arms in their hands, had abandoned the expedition,
and were seeking to escape from the island.</p>

<p>In a similar spirit the present chief magistrate alluded
to our relations with Spain in his inaugural address, in
the following explicit terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Indeed it is not to be disguised that our attitude as a
nation, and our position on the globe, render the acquisition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
of certain possessions, not within our jurisdiction, eminently
important, if not, in the future, essential for the preservation
of the rights of commerce and the peace of the world.
Should they be obtained, it will be through no grasping
spirit, but with a view to obvious national interest and security,
and in a manner entirely consistent with the strictest
observance of national faith."</p>

<p>A recent proclamation, emanating from the same source,
and warning our citizens of the consequences of engaging
in an invasion of the island, also attests the determination
to maintain the integrity of our relations with an allied
power.</p>

<p>No candid student of the history of our relations with
Spain can fail to be impressed by the frank and honorable
attitude of our government, or to contrast its acts with
those of the Spanish officials of Cuba. A history of the
commercial intercourse of our citizens with the island would
be a history of petty and also serious annoyances and grievances
to which they have been subjected for a series of years
by the Spanish officials, increasing in magnitude as the latter
have witnessed the forbearance and magnanimity of our government.
Not an American merchant or captain, who has had
dealings with Cuba, but could furnish his list of insults and
outrages, some in the shape of illegal extortions and delays,
others merely gratuitous ebullitions of spite and malice dictated
by a hatred of our country and its citizens. Of late
instances of outrage so flagrant have occurred, that the exec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>utive
has felt bound to call the attention of Congress to
them in a message, in which he points out the great evil
which lies at the bottom, and also the remedy.</p>

<p>"The offending party," he says, "is at our doors with
large power for aggression, but none, it is alleged, for reparation.
The source of redress is in another hemisphere; and
the answers to our just complaints, made to the home government,
are but the repetition of excuses rendered by inferior
officials to the superiors, in reply to the representations of
misconduct. In giving extraordinary power to them, she
owes it to justice, and to her friendly relations to this government,
to guard with great vigilance against the exorbitant
exercise of these powers, and in case of injuries to provide
for prompt redress."</p>

<p>It is very clear that if, in such cases as the seizure of a
vessel and her cargo by the port officers at Havana, for an
alleged violation of revenue laws, or even port usages, redress,
in case of official misconduct, can only be had by
reference to the home government in another part of the
world, our trade with Cuba will be completely paralyzed.
The delay and difficulty in obtaining such redress has already,
in too many cases, prompted extortion on the one hand, and
acquiescence to injustice on the other. The experience of
the last four years alone will fully sustain the truth of this
assertion.</p>

<p>In 1851 two American vessels were seized off Yucatan
by the Spanish authorities on suspicion of being engaged in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
the Lopez expedition; in the same year the steamship Falcon
was wantonly fired upon by a Spanish government vessel;
in 1852 the American mail bags were forcibly opened
and their contents examined by order of the captain-general;
and less than two years ago, as is well known, the Crescent
City was not allowed to land her passengers and mails, simply
because the purser, Smith, was obnoxious to the government
of the island. The Black Warrior, fired into on one
voyage, was seized lately for a violation of a custom house
form&mdash;an affair not yet, it is believed, settled with the
Spanish government. More than once, on specious pretexts,
have American sailors been taken from American vessels
and thrown into Spanish prisons. In short, the insults offered
by Spanish officials to our flag have so multiplied of
late that the popular indignation in the country has reached
an alarming height.</p>

<p>It is difficult for a republic and a despotism, situated like
the United States and Cuba, to live on neighborly terms;
and to control the indignation of the citizens of the former,
proud and high spirited, conscious of giving no offence, and
yet subjected to repeated insults, is a task almost too great
for the most adroit and pacific administration. When we
add to this feeling among our people a consciousness that
Cuba, the source of all this trouble, is in unwilling vassalage
to Spain, and longing for annexation to the United States,
that under our flag the prosperity of her people would be
secured, a vast addition made to our commercial resources,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
an invaluable safeguard given to our southern frontier, and
the key to the Mississippi and the great west made secure
forever, we can no longer wonder at the spread of the conviction
that Cuba should belong to this country, and this
too as soon as can be honorably brought about. Had she
possessed more foresight and less pride, Spain would have
long since sold the island to the United States, and thereby
have relieved herself of a weighty care and a most dangerous
property.</p>

<p>"So far from being really injured by the loss of the island,"
says Hon. Edward Everett, in his able and well
known letter to the British minister rejecting the proposition
for the tripartite convention, "there is no doubt that,
were it peacefully transferred to the United States, a prosperous
commerce between Cuba and Spain, resulting from
ancient associations and common language and tastes, would
be far more productive than the best contrived system of
colonial taxation. Such, notoriously, has been the result to
Great Britain of the establishment of the independence of
the United States."</p>

<p>If it be true that the American minister at Madrid has
been authorized to offer a price nothing short of a royal
ransom for the island, we cannot conceive that the greedy
queen, and even the Cortes of Spain, would reject it, unless
secretly influenced by the powers which had the effrontery to
propose for our acceptance the tripartite treaty, by which we
were expected to renounce forever all pretension to the posses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>sion
of Cuba. It is difficult to believe that France and England
could for a moment seriously suppose that such a ridiculous
proposition would be for one moment entertained by this
government, and yet they must so have deceived themselves,
or otherwise they would not have made the proposition as
they did.</p>

<p>Of the importance, not to say necessity, of the possession
of Cuba by the United States, statesmen of all parties are
agreed; and they are by no means in advance of the popular
sentiment; indeed, the class who urge its immediate
acquisition, at any cost, by any means, not as a source of
wealth, but as a political necessity, is by no means inconsiderable.
It would be foreign to our purpose to quote the
opinions of any ultraists, nor do we design, in these closing
remarks, to enter the field of politics, or political discussion.
We have endeavored to state facts only, and to state them
plainly, deducing the most incontrovertible conclusions.</p>

<p>We find the following remarks in a recent conservative
speech of Mr. Latham, a member of Congress, from California.
They present, with emphasis, some of the points
we have lightly touched upon:</p>

<p>"I admit that our relations with Spain, growing out of
that island (Cuba), are of an extremely delicate nature;
that the fate of that island, its misgovernment, its proximity
to our shores, and the particular institutions established
upon it, are of vast importance to the peace and security of
this country; and that the utmost vigilance in regard to it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
is not only demanded by prudence, but an act of imperative
duty on the part of our government. The island of Cuba
commands, in a measure, the Gulf of Mexico. In case of
a maritime war, in which the United States may be engaged,
its possession by the enemy might become a source of infinite
annoyance to us, crippling our shipping, threatening
the great emporium of our southern commerce, and exposing
our whole southern coast, from the capes of Florida to
the mouth of the Rio Grande, to the enemy's cruisers. The
geographical position of Cuba is such that we cannot, without
a total disregard to our own safety, permit it to pass
into the hands of any first-class power; nay, that it would
be extremely imprudent to allow it to pass even into the
hands of a power of the second rank, possessed of energy
and capacity for expansion."</p>

<p>If Cuba come into our possession peaceably, as the fruits
of a fair bargain, or as a free-will offering of her sons, after
a successful revolution, we can predict for her a future as
bright as her past has been desolate and gloomy; for the
union of a territory with a foreign population to our confederacy
is no new and doubtful experiment. Louisiana,
with her French and Spanish Creoles, is one of the most
reliable states of the Union; and, not long after her admission,
she signed, with her best blood, the pledge of fealty to
the common country.</p>

<p>More recently, we all remember how, when Taylor, in
the presence of the foe upon the Rio Grande, called for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
volunteers, the gallant Creoles rushed to arms, and crowded
to his banner. The Creoles of Cuba are of the same blood
and lineage,&mdash;Spaniards in chivalry of soul, without the
ferocity and fanaticism of the descendants of the Cid. We
are sure, from what they have shown in the past, that
liberal institutions will develop latent qualities which need
only free air for their expansion. They will not want companions,
friends and helpers. A tide of emigration from
the States will pour into the island, the waste lands will be
reclaimed, and their hidden wealth disclosed; a new system
of agricultural economy will be introduced; the woods of
the island will furnish material for splendid ships; towns
and villages will rise with magical celerity, and the whole
surface of the "garden of the world" will blossom like the
rose.</p>

<p>"Rich in soil, salubrious in climate, varied in productions,
the home of commerce," says the Hon. O.R. Singleton,
of Mississippi, "Cuba seems to have been formed to
become 'the very button on Fortune's cap.' Washed by
the Gulf-stream on half her borders, with the Mississippi
pouring out its rich treasures on one side, and the Amazon,
destined to become a 'cornucopia,' on the other,&mdash;with the
ports of Havana and Matanzas on the north, and the Isle of
Pines and St. Jago de Cuba on the south, Nature has written
upon her, in legible characters, a destiny far above that
of a subjugated province of a rotten European dynasty.
Her home is in the bosom of the North American confed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>eracy.
Like a lost Pleiad, she may wander on for a few
months or years in lawless, chaotic confusion; but, ultimately,
the laws of nature and of nations will vindicate
themselves, and she will assume her true social and political
condition, despite the diplomacy of statesmen, the trickery
of knaves, or the frowns of tyrants. Cuba will be free.
The spirit is abroad among her people; and, although they
dare not give utterance to their thoughts, lest some treacherous
breeze should bear them to a tyrant's ears, still they
think and feel, and will act when the proper time shall
arrive. The few who have dared 'to do or die' have fallen,
and their blood still marks the spot where they fell. Such
has been the case in all great revolutionary struggles.
Those who lead the van must expect a sharp encounter
before they break through the serried hosts of tyranny, and
many a good man falls upon the threshold of the temple.</p>

<p>"He has given a piece of a young man's life in one of the lesser cities
of New England; has described with marvellous accuracy the littleness
and greatness of life in such a city; has drawn a manly character of his
hero, simple, self-possessed, and dignified, most enviable, and not impossible.
The word painting with which he portrays the natural scenery of
New England has a life and distinctness unattained, we believe, by any
one beside who has attempted it with pen or pencil. The book is very
interesting from the beginning; a story well wrought."&mdash;<i>Daily Advertiser.</i></p>

To the theologian it is invaluable, while to the general reader it is as interesting
as an Oriental romance, being in the form of a narrative, with frequent
flashes of magnificent poetry. The account of the birth of Mohammed,
especially, is exquisitely beautiful."&mdash;<i>E.P. Whipple.</i></p>
